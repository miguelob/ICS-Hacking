.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBTShark\fR is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet
data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved
capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the
standard output or writing the packets to a file.  \fBTShark\fR's native
capture file format is \fBpcapng\fR format, which is also the format used
by \fBwireshark\fR and various other tools.
.PP
Without any options set, \fBTShark\fR will work much like \fBtcpdump\fR.  It
will use the pcap library to capture traffic from the first available
network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for
each received packet.
.PP
When run with the \fB\-r\fR option, specifying a capture file from which to
read, \fBTShark\fR will again work much like \fBtcpdump\fR, reading packets
from the file and displaying a summary line on the standard output for
each packet read.  \fBTShark\fR is able to detect, read and write the same
capture files that are supported by \fBWireshark\fR.  The input file
doesn't need a specific filename extension; the file format and an
optional gzip compression will be automatically detected.  Near the
beginning of the \s-1DESCRIPTION\s0 section of \fBwireshark\fR\|(1) or
<https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man\-pages/wireshark.html> is a detailed
description of the way \fBWireshark\fR handles this, which is the same way
\&\fBTshark\fR handles this.
.PP
Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present when compiling \fBTShark\fR, it will be
possible to compile it, but the resulting program will be unable to read
compressed files.
.PP
When displaying packets on the standard output, \fBTShark\fR writes, by
default, a summary line containing the fields specified by the
preferences file (which are also the fields displayed in the packet list
pane in \fBWireshark\fR), although if it's writing packets as it captures
them, rather than writing packets from a saved capture file, it won't
show the \*(L"frame number\*(R" field.  If the \fB\-V\fR option is specified, it
instead writes a view of the details of the packet, showing all the
fields of all protocols in the packet.  If the \fB\-O\fR option is
specified, it will only show the full details for the protocols
specified, and show only the top-level detail line for all other
protocols.  Use the output of "\fBtshark \-G protocols\fR" to find the
abbreviations of the protocols you can specify.  If the \fB\-P\fR option is
specified with either the \fB\-V\fR or \fB\-O\fR options, both the summary line
for the entire packet and the details will be displayed.
.PP
Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  That library
supports specifying a filter expression; packets that don't match that
filter are discarded.  The \fB\-f\fR option is used to specify a capture
filter.  The syntax of a capture filter is defined by the pcap library;
this syntax is different from the read filter syntax described below,
and the filtering mechanism is limited in its abilities.
.PP
Read filters in \fBTShark\fR, which allow you to select which packets are
to be decoded or written to a file, are very powerful; more fields are
filterable in \fBTShark\fR than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax
you can use to create your filters is richer.  As \fBTShark\fR progresses,
expect more and more protocol fields to be allowed in read filters.
Read filters use the same syntax as display and color filters in
\&\fBWireshark\fR; a read filter is specified with the \fB\-R\fR option.
.PP
Read filters can be specified when capturing or when reading from a
capture file.  Note that that capture filters are much more efficient
than read filters, and it may be more difficult for \fBTShark\fR to keep up
with a busy network if a read filter is specified for a live capture, so
you might be more likely to lose packets if you're using a read filter.
.PP
A capture or read filter can either be specified with the \fB\-f\fR or \fB\-R\fR
option, respectively, in which case the entire filter expression must be
specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains spaces,
it must be quoted), or can be specified with command-line arguments
after the option arguments, in which case all the arguments after the
filter arguments are treated as a filter expression.  If the filter is
specified with command-line arguments after the option arguments, it's a
capture filter if a capture is being done (i.e., if no \fB\-r\fR option was
specified) and a read filter if a capture file is being read (i.e., if a
\&\fB\-r\fR option was specified).
.PP
If the \fB\-w\fR option is specified when capturing packets or reading from
a capture file, \fBTShark\fR does not display packets on the standard
output.  Instead, it writes the packets to a capture file with the name
specified by the \fB\-w\fR option.
.PP
If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run
\&\fBTShark\fR without the \fB\-w\fR option, and redirect its standard output to
the file (do \fInot\fR use the \fB\-w\fR option).
.PP
If you want the packets to be displayed to the standard output and also
saved to a file, specify the \fB\-P\fR option in addition to the \fB\-w\fR
option to have the summary line displayed, specify the \fB\-V\fR option
in addition to the \fB\-w\fR option to have the details of the packet
displayed, and specify the \fB\-O\fR option, with a list of protocols, to
have the full details of the specified protocols and the top-level
detail line for all other protocols to be displayed.  If the \fB\-P\fR
option is used together with the \fB\-V\fR or \fB\-O\fR option, the summary line
will be displayed along with the detail lines.
.PP
When writing packets to a file, \fBTShark\fR, by default, writes the file
in \fBpcapng\fR format, and writes all of the packets it sees to the output
file.  The \fB\-F\fR option can be used to specify the format in which to
write the file.  This list of available file formats is displayed by the
\&\fB\-F\fR option without a value.  However, you can't specify a file format
for a live capture.
.PP
When capturing packets, \fBTShark\fR writes to the standard error an
initial line listing the interfaces from which packets are being
captured and, if packet information isn't being displayed to the
terminal, writes a continuous count of packets captured to the standard
output.  If the \fB\-q\fR option is specified, neither the continuous count
nor the packet information will be displayed; instead, at the end of the
capture, a count of packets captured will be displayed.  If the \fB\-Q\fR
option is specified, neither the initial line, nor the packet
information, nor any packet counts will be displayed.  If the \fB\-q\fR or
\&\fB\-Q\fR option is used, the \fB\-P\fR, \fB\-V\fR, or \fB\-O\fR option can be used to
cause the corresponding output to be displayed even though other output
is suppressed.
.PP
When reading packets, the \fB\-q\fR and \fB\-Q\fR option will suppress the
display of the packet summary or details; this would be used if \fB\-z\fR
options are specified in order to display statistics, so that only the
statistics, not the packet information, is displayed.
.PP
The \fB\-G\fR option is a special mode that simply causes \fBTshark\fR
to dump one of several types of internal glossaries and then exit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-2" 4
.IX Item "-2"
Perform a two-pass analysis. This causes tshark to buffer output until the
entire first pass is done, but allows it to fill in fields that require future
knowledge, such as 'response in frame #' fields. Also permits reassembly
frame dependencies to be calculated correctly.
.IP "\-a|\-\-autostop  <capture autostop condition>" 4
.IX Item "-a|--autostop <capture autostop condition>"
Specify a criterion that specifies when \fBTShark\fR is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form \fItest\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
where \fItest\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBduration\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fR seconds
have elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.Sp
\&\fBfiles\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to capture files after \fIvalue\fR number of files
were written.
.Sp
\&\fBfilesize\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
\&\fIvalue\fR kB.  If this option is used together with the \-b option, \fBTShark\fR
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  When reading a capture file, \fBTShark\fR will stop reading
the file after the number of bytes read exceeds this number (the complete
packet  will be read, so more bytes than this number may be read).  Note that
the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 GiB.
.Sp
\&\fBpackets\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fR
packets. Same as \fB\-c\fR<capture packet count>.
.IP "\-b|\-\-ring\-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>" 4
.IX Item "-b|--ring-buffer <capture ring buffer option>"
Cause \fBTShark\fR to run in \*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode.  In \*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode,
\&\fBTShark\fR will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, \fBTShark\fR will switch writing to the next file and so on.
.Sp
The created filenames are based on the filename given with the \fB\-w\fR option,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20200714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20200714120523.pcap, ...
.Sp
With the \fIfiles\fR option it's also possible to form a \*(L"ring buffer\*(R".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point \fBTShark\fR will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the \fIfiles\fR option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).
.Sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
where \fIkey\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBduration\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after \fIvalue\fR seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.Sp
\&\fBfiles\fR:\fIvalue\fR begin again with the first file after \fIvalue\fR number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The \fBfiles\fR criterion
requires either \fBduration\fR, \fBinterval\fR or \fBfilesize\fR to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each \fB\-b\fR
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criterion, each must be
preceded by the \fB\-b\fR option.
.Sp
\&\fBfilesize\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
\&\fIvalue\fR kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 GiB.
.Sp
\&\fBinterval\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of \fIvalue\fR seconds.  For example, use 3600 to switch to a new file
every hour on the hour.
.Sp
\&\fBpackets\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fR
packets.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-b filesize:1000 \-b files:5\fR results in a ring buffer of five
files of size one megabyte each.
.IP "\-B|\-\-buffer\-size  <capture buffer size>" 4
.IX Item "-B|--buffer-size <capture buffer size>"
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while \fBTshark\fR attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you're capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.
.Sp
This is available on \s-1UNIX\s0 systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or later and on
Windows.  It is not available on \s-1UNIX\s0 systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.
.IP "\-c  <capture packet count>" 4
.IX Item "-c <capture packet count>"
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data. Same as \fB\-a packets:\fR<capture packet count>.
If reading a capture file, set the maximum number of packets to read.
.IP "\-C  <configuration profile>" 4
.IX Item "-C <configuration profile>"
Run with the given configuration profile.
.IP "\-d  <layer type>==<selector>,<decode\-as protocol>" 4
.IX Item "-d <layer type>==<selector>,<decode-as protocol>"
Like Wireshark's \fBDecode As...\fR feature, this lets you specify how a
layer type should be dissected.  If the layer type in question (for example,
\&\fBtcp.port\fR or \fBudp.port\fR for a \s-1TCP\s0 or \s-1UDP\s0 port number) has the specified
selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-d tcp.port==8888,http\fR will decode any traffic running over
\&\s-1TCP\s0 port 8888 as \s-1HTTP.\s0
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-d tcp.port==8888:3,http\fR will decode any traffic running over
\&\s-1TCP\s0 ports 8888, 8889 or 8890 as \s-1HTTP.\s0
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-d tcp.port==8888\-8890,http\fR will decode any traffic running
over \s-1TCP\s0 ports 8888, 8889 or 8890 as \s-1HTTP.\s0
.Sp
Using an invalid selector or protocol will print out a list of valid selectors
and protocol names, respectively.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-d .\fR is a quick way to get a list of valid selectors.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-d ethertype==0x0800.\fR is a quick way to get a list of
protocols that can be selected with an ethertype.
.IP "\-D|\-\-list\-interfaces" 4
.IX Item "-D|--list-interfaces"
Print a list of the interfaces on which \fBTShark\fR can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the \fB\-i\fR option to specify an interface on which to capture.
.Sp
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(\s-1UNIX\s0 systems lacking \fBifconfig \-a\fR or Linux systems lacking
\&\fBip link show\fR). The number can be useful on Windows systems, where
the interface name might be a long name or a \s-1GUID.\s0
.Sp
Note that \*(L"can capture\*(R" means that \fBTShark\fR was able to open that
device to do a live capture.  Depending on your system you may need to
run tshark from an account with special privileges (for example, as
root) to be able to capture network traffic.  If \fBtshark \-D\fR is not run
from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.
.IP "\-e  <field>" 4
.IX Item "-e <field>"
Add a field to the list of fields to display if \fB\-T ek|fields|json|pdml\fR
is selected.  This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
At least one field must be provided if the \fB\-T fields\fR option is
selected. Column names may be used prefixed with \*(L"_ws.col.\*(R"
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-e frame.number \-e ip.addr \-e udp \-e _ws.col.Info\fR
.Sp
Giving a protocol rather than a single field will print multiple items
of data about the protocol as a single field.  Fields are separated by
tab characters by default.  \fB\-E\fR controls the format of the printed
fields.
.IP "\-E  <field print option>" 4
.IX Item "-E <field print option>"
Set an option controlling the printing of fields when \fB\-T fields\fR is
selected.
.Sp
Options are:
.Sp
\&\fBbom=y|n\fR If \fBy\fR, prepend output with the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 byte order mark
(hexadecimal ef, bb, bf). Defaults to \fBn\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBheader=y|n\fR If \fBy\fR, print a list of the field names given using \fB\-e\fR
as the first line of the output; the field name will be separated using
the same character as the field values.  Defaults to \fBn\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBseparator=/t|/s|\fR<character> Set the separator character to
use for fields.  If \fB/t\fR tab will be used (this is the default), if
\&\fB/s\fR, a single space will be used.  Otherwise any character that can be
accepted by the command line as part of the option may be used.
.Sp
\&\fBoccurrence=f|l|a\fR Select which occurrence to use for fields that have
multiple occurrences.  If \fBf\fR the first occurrence will be used, if \fBl\fR
the last occurrence will be used and if \fBa\fR all occurrences will be used
(this is the default).
.Sp
\&\fBaggregator=,|/s|\fR<character> Set the aggregator character to
use for fields that have multiple occurrences.  If \fB,\fR a comma will be used
(this is the default), if \fB/s\fR, a single space will be used.  Otherwise
any character that can be accepted by the command line as part of the
option may be used.
.Sp
\&\fBquote=d|s|n\fR Set the quote character to use to surround fields.  \fBd\fR
uses double-quotes, \fBs\fR single-quotes, \fBn\fR no quotes (the default).
.IP "\-f  <capture filter>" 4
.IX Item "-f <capture filter>"
Set the capture filter expression.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.
.Sp
Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the \s-1GUI\s0 menu item Capture\->Capture
Filters, can be used by prefixing the argument with \*(L"predef:\*(R".
Example: \fBtshark \-f \*(L"predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter\*(R"\fR
.IP "\-F  <file format>" 4
.IX Item "-F <file format>"
Set the file format of the output capture file written using the \fB\-w\fR
option.  The output written with the \fB\-w\fR option is raw packet data, not
text, so there is no \fB\-F\fR option to request text output.  The option \fB\-F\fR
without a value will list the available formats.
.IP "\-g" 4
.IX Item "-g"
This option causes the output file(s) to be created with group-read permission
(meaning that the output file(s) can be read by other members of the calling
user's group).
.IP "\-G  [ <report type> ]" 4
.IX Item "-G [ <report type> ]"
The \fB\-G\fR option will cause \fBTshark\fR to dump one of several types of glossaries
and then exit.  If no specific glossary type is specified, then the \fBfields\fR
report will be generated by default.
Using the report type of \fBhelp\fR lists all the current report types.
.Sp

.Ve
.IP "\-h|\-\-help" 4
.IX Item "-h|--help"
Print the version and options and exit.
.IP "\-H  <input hosts file>" 4
.IX Item "-H <input hosts file>"
Read a list of entries from a \*(L"hosts\*(R" file, which will then be written
to a capture file.  Implies \fB\-W n\fR. Can be called multiple times.
.Sp
The \*(L"hosts\*(R" file format is documented at
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)>.
.IP "\-i|\-\-interface  <capture interface> | \-" 4
.IX Item "-i|--interface <capture interface> | -"
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.
.Sp
Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
"\fBtshark \-D\fR\*(L" (described above); a number, as reported by
\&\*(R"\fBtshark \-D\fR\*(L", can also be used.  If you're using \s-1UNIX, \*(R"\s0\fBnetstat
\&\-i\fR\*(L", \*(R"\fBifconfig \-a\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\fBip link\fR" might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of \s-1UNIX\s0 support the \fB\-a\fR option to \fBifconfig\fR.
.Sp
If no interface is specified, \fBTShark\fR searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
\&\fBTShark\fR reports an error and doesn't start the capture.
.Sp
Pipe names should be either the name of a \s-1FIFO\s0 (named pipe) or \*(L"\-\*(R" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\e\epipe\e.\e\fBpipename\fR".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple
interfaces, the capture file will be saved in pcapng format.
.IP "\-I|\-\-monitor\-mode" 4
.IX Item "-I|--monitor-mode"
Put the interface in \*(L"monitor mode\*(R"; this is supported only on \s-1IEEE
802.11\s0 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.
.Sp
Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it enables the monitor mode for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.
.IP "\-j  <protocol match filter>" 4
.IX Item "-j <protocol match filter>"
Protocol match filter used for ek|json|jsonraw|pdml output file types.
Only the protocol's parent node is included. Child nodes are only
included if explicitly specified in the filter.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-j \*(L"ip ip.flags http\*(R"\fR
.IP "\-J  <protocol match filter>" 4
.IX Item "-J <protocol match filter>"
Protocol top level filter used for ek|json|jsonraw|pdml output file types.
The protocol's parent node and all child nodes are included.
Lower-level protocols must be explicitly specified in the filter.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-J \*(L"tcp http\*(R"\fR
.IP "\-K  <keytab>" 4
.IX Item "-K <keytab>"
Load kerberos crypto keys from the specified keytab file.
This option can be used multiple times to load keys from several files.
.Sp
Example: \fBtshark \-K krb5.keytab\fR
.IP "\-l" 4
.IX Item "-l"
Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is
printed.  (This is not, strictly speaking, line-buffered if \fB\-V\fR
was specified; however, it is the same as line-buffered if \fB\-V\fR wasn't
specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as \fB\-l\fR is
normally used when piping a live capture to a program or script, so that
output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is seen and
dissected, it should work just as well as true line-buffering.  We do
this as a workaround for a deficiency in the Microsoft Visual \*(C+ C
library.)
.Sp
This may be useful when piping the output of \fBTShark\fR to another
program, as it means that the program to which the output is piped will
see the dissected data for a packet as soon as \fBTShark\fR sees the
packet and generates that output, rather than seeing it only when the
standard output buffer containing that data fills up.
.IP "\-L|\-\-list\-data\-link\-types" 4
.IX Item "-L|--list-data-link-types"
List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.  The reported
link types can be used for the \fB\-y\fR option.
.IP "\-n" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, \s-1TCP\s0 and \s-1UDP\s0 port
names); the \fB\-N\fR option might override this one.
.IP "\-N  <name resolving flags>" 4
.IX Item "-N <name resolving flags>"
Turn on name resolving only for particular types of addresses and port
numbers, with name resolving for other types of addresses and port
numbers turned off.  This option overrides \fB\-n\fR if both \fB\-N\fR and \fB\-n\fR
are present.  If both \fB\-N\fR and \fB\-n\fR options are not present, all name
resolutions are turned on.
.Sp
The argument is a string that may contain the letters:
.Sp
\&\fBd\fR to enable resolution from captured \s-1DNS\s0 packets
.Sp
\&\fBm\fR to enable \s-1MAC\s0 address resolution
.Sp
\&\fBn\fR to enable network address resolution
.Sp
\&\fBN\fR to enable using external resolvers (e.g., \s-1DNS\s0) for network address
resolution
.Sp
\&\fBt\fR to enable transport-layer port number resolution
.Sp
\&\fBv\fR to enable \s-1VLAN\s0 IDs to names resolution
.IP "\-o  <preference>:<value>" 4
.IX Item "-o <preference>:<value>"
Set a preference value, overriding the default value and any value read
from a preference file.  The argument to the option is a string of the
form \fIprefname\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR, where \fIprefname\fR is the name of the
preference (which is the same name that would appear in the preference
file), and \fIvalue\fR is the value to which it should be set.
.IP "\-O  <protocols>" 4
.IX Item "-O <protocols>"
Similar to the \fB\-V\fR option, but causes \fBTShark\fR to only show a
detailed view of the comma-separated list of \fIprotocols\fR specified, and
show only the top-level detail line for all other protocols, rather than
a detailed view of all protocols.  Use the output of "\fBtshark \-G
protocols\fR" to find the abbreviations of the protocols you can specify.
.IP "\-p|\-\-no\-promiscuous\-mode" 4
.IX Item "-p|--no-promiscuous-mode"
\&\fIDon't\fR put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the
interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence,
\&\fB\-p\fR cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
traffic sent to or from the machine on which \fBTShark\fR is running,
broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic to addresses received by that
machine.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, no interface will be put into the
promiscuous mode.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR
option occurring before this option will not be put into the
promiscuous mode.
.IP "\-P|\-\-print" 4
.IX Item "-P|--print"
Decode and display the packet summary or details, even if writing raw
packet data using the \fB\-w\fR option, and even if packet output is
otherwise suppressed with \fB\-Q\fR.
.IP "\-q" 4
.IX Item "-q"
When capturing packets, don't display the continuous count of packets
captured that is normally shown when saving a capture to a file;
instead, just display, at the end of the capture, a count of packets
captured.  On systems that support the \s-1SIGINFO\s0 signal, such as various
BSDs, you can cause the current count to be displayed by typing your
\&\*(L"status\*(R" character (typically control-T, although it
might be set to \*(L"disabled\*(R" by default on at least some BSDs, so you'd
have to explicitly set it to use it).
.Sp
When reading a capture file, or when capturing and not saving to a file,
don't print packet information; this is useful if you're using a \fB\-z\fR
option to calculate statistics and don't want the packet information
printed, just the statistics.
.IP "\-Q" 4
.IX Item "-Q"
When capturing packets, don't display, on the standard error, the
initial message indicating on which interfaces the capture is being
done, the continuous count of packets captured shown when saving a
capture to a file, and the final message giving the count of packets
captured.  Only true errors are displayed on the standard error.
.Sp
only display true errors; don't display the
initial message indicating the.  This outputs less
than the \fB\-q\fR option, so the interface name and total packet
count and the end of a capture are not sent to stderr.
.Sp
When reading a capture file, or when capturing and not saving to a file,
don't print packet information; this is useful if you're using a \fB\-z\fR
option to calculate statistics and don't want the packet information
printed, just the statistics.
.IP "\-r|\-\-read\-file  <infile>" 4
.IX Item "-r|--read-file <infile>"
Read packet data from \fIinfile\fR, can be any supported capture file format
(including gzipped files).  It is possible to use named pipes or stdin (\-)
here but only with certain (not compressed) capture file formats (in
particular: those that can be read without seeking backwards).
.IP "\-R|\-\-read\-filter  <Read filter>" 4
.IX Item "-R|--read-filter <Read filter>"
Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters,
rather than that of capture filters) to be applied during the first pass of
analysis. Packets not matching the filter are not considered for future
passes. Only makes sense with multiple passes, see \-2. For regular filtering
on single-pass dissect see \-Y instead.
.Sp
Note that forward-looking fields such as 'response in frame #' cannot be used
with this filter, since they will not have been calculate when this filter is
applied.
.IP "\-s|\-\-snapshot\-length  <capture snaplen>" 4
.IX Item "-s|--snapshot-length <capture snaplen>"
Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data.
No more than \fIsnaplen\fR bytes of each network packet will be read into
memory, or saved to disk.  A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default snapshot length.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the snapshot length for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the snapshot length is not set specifically,
the default snapshot length is used if provided.
.IP "\-S  <separator>" 4
.IX Item "-S <separator>"
Set the line separator to be printed between packets.
.IP "\-t  a|ad|adoy|d|dd|e|r|u|ud|udoy" 4
.IX Item "-t a|ad|adoy|d|dd|e|r|u|ud|udoy"
Set the format of the packet timestamp printed in summary lines.
The format can be one of:
.Sp
\&\fBa\fR absolute: The absolute time, as local time in your time zone,
is the actual time the packet was captured, with no date displayed
.Sp
\&\fBad\fR absolute with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD,
and time, as local time in your time zone, is the actual time and date
the packet was captured
.Sp
\&\fBadoy\fR absolute with date using day of year: The absolute date,
displayed as \s-1YYYY/DOY,\s0 and time, as local time in your time zone,
is the actual time and date the packet was captured
.Sp
\&\fBd\fR delta: The delta time is the time since the previous packet was
captured
.Sp
\&\fBdd\fR delta_displayed: The delta_displayed time is the time since the
previous displayed packet was captured
.Sp
\&\fBe\fR epoch: The time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00)
.Sp
\&\fBr\fR relative: The relative time is the time elapsed between the first packet
and the current packet
.Sp
\&\fBu\fR \s-1UTC:\s0 The absolute time, as \s-1UTC,\s0 is the actual time the packet was
captured, with no date displayed
.Sp
\&\fBud\fR \s-1UTC\s0 with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD,
and time, as \s-1UTC,\s0 is the actual time and date the packet was captured
.Sp
\&\fBudoy\fR \s-1UTC\s0 with date using day of year: The absolute date, displayed
as \s-1YYYY/DOY,\s0 and time, as \s-1UTC,\s0 is the actual time and date the packet
was captured
.Sp
The default format is relative.
.IP "\-T  ek|fields|json|jsonraw|pdml|ps|psml|tabs|text" 4
.IX Item "-T ek|fields|json|jsonraw|pdml|ps|psml|tabs|text"
Set the format of the output when viewing decoded packet data.  The
options are one of:
.Sp
\&\fBek\fR Newline delimited \s-1JSON\s0 format for bulk import into Elasticsearch.
It can be used with \fB\-j\fR or \fB\-J\fR to specify
which protocols to include or with
\&\fB\-x\fR to include raw hex-encoded packet data.
If \fB\-P\fR is specified it will print the packet summary only, with both
\&\fB\-P\fR and \fB\-V\fR it will print the packet summary and packet details.
If neither \fB\-P\fR or \fB\-V\fR are used it will print the packet details only.
Example of usage to import data into Elasticsearch:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  tshark \-T ek \-j "http tcp ip" \-P \-V \-x \-r file.pcap > file.json
\&  curl \-H "Content\-Type: application/x\-ndjson" \-XPOST http://elasticsearch:9200/_bulk \-\-data\-binary "@file.json"
.Ve
.Sp
Elastic requires a mapping file to be loaded as template for packets\-*
index in order to convert Wireshark types to elastic types. This file
can be auto-generated with the command \*(L"tshark \-G elastic-mapping\*(R". Since
the mapping file can be huge, protocols can be selected by using the option
\&\-\-elastic\-mapping\-filter:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tshark \-G elastic\-mapping \-\-elastic\-mapping\-filter ip,udp,dns
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBfields\fR The values of fields specified with the \fB\-e\fR option, in a
form specified by the \fB\-E\fR option.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tshark \-T fields \-E separator=, \-E quote=d
.Ve
.Sp
would generate comma-separated values (\s-1CSV\s0) output suitable for importing
into your favorite spreadsheet program.
.Sp
\&\fBjson\fR \s-1JSON\s0 file format.  It can be used with \fB\-j\fR or \fB\-J\fR to specify
which protocols to include or with \fB\-x\fR option to include
raw hex-encoded packet data.  Example of usage:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  tshark \-T json \-r file.pcap
\&  tshark \-T json \-j "http tcp ip" \-x \-r file.pcap
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBjsonraw\fR \s-1JSON\s0 file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data.

.Sp
\&\fBpdml\fR Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the
details of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
packet details printed with the \fB\-V\fR option.  Using the \-\-color option
will add color attributes to \fBpdml\fR output.  These attributes are
nonstandard.
.Sp
\&\fBps\fR PostScript for a human-readable one-line summary of each of the
packets, or a multi-line view of the details of each of the packets,
depending on whether the \fB\-V\fR option was specified.
.Sp
\&\fBpsml\fR Packet Summary Markup Language, an XML-based format for the summary
information of a decoded packet.  This information is equivalent to the
information shown in the one-line summary printed by default.
Using the \-\-color option will add color attributes to \fBpdml\fR output. These
attributes are nonstandard.
.Sp
\&\fBtabs\fR Similar to the default \fBtext\fR report except the human-readable one-line
summary of each packet will include an \s-1ASCII\s0 horizontal tab (0x09) character
as a delimiter between each column.
.Sp
\&\fBtext\fR Text of a human-readable one-line summary of each of the packets, or a
multi-line view of the details of each of the packets, depending on
whether the \fB\-V\fR option was specified.  This is the default.
.IP "\-u <seconds type>" 4
.IX Item "-u <seconds type>"
Specifies the seconds type.  Valid choices are:
.Sp
\&\fBs\fR for seconds
.Sp
\&\fBhms\fR for hours, minutes and seconds
.IP "\-U <tap name>" 4
.IX Item "-U <tap name>"
PDUs export, exports PDUs from infile to outfile according to the tap name given.
Use \-Y to filter.
.Sp
Enter an empty tap name "" to get a list of available names.
.IP "\-v|\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "-v|--version"
Print the version and exit.
.IP "\-V" 4
.IX Item "-V"
Cause \fBTShark\fR to print a view of the packet details.
.IP "\-w  <outfile> | \-" 4
.IX Item "-w <outfile> | -"
Write raw packet data to \fIoutfile\fR or to the standard output if
\&\fIoutfile\fR is '\-'.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 \-w provides raw packet data, not text.  If you want text output
you need to redirect stdout (e.g. using '>'), don't use the \fB\-w\fR
option for this.
.IP "\-W  <file format option>" 4
.IX Item "-W <file format option>"
Save extra information in the file if the format supports it.  For
example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  tshark \-F pcapng \-W n
.Ve
.Sp
will save host name resolution records along with captured packets.
.Sp
Future versions of \fBTshark\fR may automatically change the capture format
to \fBpcapng\fR as needed.
.Sp
The argument is a string that may contain the following letter:
.Sp
\&\fBn\fR write network address resolution information (pcapng only)
.IP "\-x" 4
.IX Item "-x"
Cause \fBTShark\fR to print a hex and \s-1ASCII\s0 dump of the packet data
after printing the summary and/or details, if either are also being displayed.
.IP "\-X <eXtension options>" 4
.IX Item "-X <eXtension options>"
Specify an option to be passed to a \fBTShark\fR module.  The eXtension option
is in the form \fIextension_key\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR, where \fIextension_key\fR can be:
.Sp
\&\fBlua_script\fR:\fIlua_script_filename\fR tells \fBTShark\fR to load the given script in
addition to the default Lua scripts.
.Sp
\&\fBlua_script\fR\fInum\fR:\fIargument\fR tells \fBTShark\fR to pass the given argument
to the lua script identified by 'num', which is the number indexed order of the
\&'lua_script' command. For example, if only one script was loaded with
\&'\-X lua_script:my.lua', then '\-X lua_script1:foo' will pass the string 'foo' to
the 'my.lua' script.  If two scripts were loaded, such as '\-X lua_script:my.lua'
and '\-X lua_script:other.lua' in that order, then a '\-X lua_script2:bar' would
pass the string 'bar' to the second lua script, namely 'other.lua'.
.Sp
\&\fBread_format\fR:\fIfile_format\fR tells \fBTShark\fR to use the given file format to
read in the file (the file given in the \fB\-r\fR command option). Providing no
\&\fIfile_format\fR argument, or an invalid one, will produce a file of available
file formats to use.
.IP "\-y|\-\-linktype  <capture link type>" 4
.IX Item "-y|--linktype <capture link type>"
Set the data link type to use while capturing packets.  The values
reported by \fB\-L\fR are the values that can be used.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture link type.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture link type for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture link type is not set specifically,
the default capture link type is used if provided.
.IP "\-Y|\-\-display\-filter  <displaY filter>" 4
.IX Item "-Y|--display-filter <displaY filter>"
Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters,
rather than that of capture filters) to be applied before printing a
decoded form of packets or writing packets to a file.  Packets matching the

.IP "\-z  <statistics>" 4
.IX Item "-z <statistics>"
Get \fBTShark\fR to collect various types of statistics and display the

if you're reading a capture file and only want the statistics printed,
not any per-packet information.
.Sp
Note that the \fB\-z proto\fR option is different \- it doesn't cause
statistics to be gathered and printed when the capture is complete, it
modifies the regular packet summary output to include the values of
fields specified with the option.  Therefore you must not use the \fB\-q\fR
option, as that option would suppress the printing of the regular packet
summary output, and must also not use the \fB\-V\fR option, as that would
cause packet detail information rather than packet summary information
to be printed.

file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous values.  Note: If
the command line option \fB\-o\fR is used (possibly more than once), it will
in turn override values from the preferences files.
.Sp
The preferences settings are in the form \fIprefname\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
one per line,
where \fIprefname\fR is the name of the preference
and \fIvalue\fR is the value to
which it should be set; white space is allowed between \fB:\fR and

indenting the continuation lines with white space.  A \fB#\fR character
starts a comment that runs to the end of the line:

match is found) then a partial match is attempted via the \fIsubnets\fR file.
.Sp
Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length
separated only by a / and a name separated by whitespace. While the address
must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the mask length are subsequently
ignored.
.Sp
An example is:
.Sp
# Comments must be prepended by the # sign!
192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network
.Sp
A partially matched name will be printed as \*(L"subnet\-name.remaining\-address\*(R".
For example, \*(L"192.168.0.1\*(R" under the subnet above would be printed as
\&\*(L"ws_test_network.1\*(R"; if the mask length above had been 16 rather than 24, the
printed address would be ``ws_test_network.0.1".
.IP "Name Resolution (ethers)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (ethers)"
The \fIethers\fR files are consulted to correlate 6\-byte hardware addresses to
names.  First the personal \fIethers\fR file is tried and if an address is not
found there the global \fIethers\fR file is tried next.
.Sp
Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The digits of the hardware address are separated by colons
(:), dashes (\-) or periods (.).  The same separator character must be
used consistently in an address.  The following three lines are valid
lines of an \fIethers\fR file:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
\&  c0\-00\-ff\-ff\-ff\-ff          TR_broadcast
\&  00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIethers\fR file is looked for in the \fI/etc\fR directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal \fIethers\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the personal
preferences file.
.Sp
Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and Npcap or WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal
\&\fIethers\fR file will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.
.IP "Name Resolution (manuf)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (manuf)"
The \fImanuf\fR file is used to match the 3\-byte vendor portion of a 6\-byte
hardware address with the manufacturer's name; it can also contain well-known
\&\s-1MAC\s0 addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask.  The format of the
file is the same as the \fIethers\fR files, except that entries of the form:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  00:00:0C      Cisco
.Ve
.Sp
can be provided, with the 3\-byte \s-1OUI\s0 and the name for a vendor, and
entries such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC/40     All\-HSRP\-routers
.Ve
.Sp
can be specified, with a \s-1MAC\s0 address and a mask indicating how many bits
of the address must match.  The above entry, for example, has 40
significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC\-00 through 00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC\-FF.  The mask need not be a
multiple of 8.
.Sp
The \fImanuf\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the global
preferences file.
.IP "Name Resolution (services)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (services)"
The \fIservices\fR file is used to translate port numbers into names.
.Sp
The file has the standard \fIservices\fR file syntax; each line contains one
(service) name and one transport identifier separated by white space.  The
transport identifier includes one port number and one transport protocol name
(typically tcp, udp, or sctp) separated by a /.
.Sp
An example is:
.Sp
mydns       5045/udp     # My own Domain Name Server
mydns       5045/tcp     # My own Domain Name Server
.IP "Name Resolution (ipxnets)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (ipxnets)"
The \fIipxnets\fR files are used to correlate 4\-byte \s-1IPX\s0 network numbers to
names.  First the global \fIipxnets\fR file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.
.Sp
The format is the same as the \fIethers\fR
file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal
number, as is more common in the \s-1IPX\s0 world, rather than four hex octets.
For example, these four lines are valid lines of an \fIipxnets\fR file:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  C0.A8.2C.00              HR
\&  c0\-a8\-1c\-00              CEO
\&  00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
\&  110f                     FileServer3
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIipxnets\fR file is looked for in the \fI/etc\fR directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal \fIipxnets\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the
personal preferences file.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
\&\fBTShark\fR uses \s-1UTF\-8\s0 to represent strings internally. In some cases the
output might not be valid. For example, a dissector might generate
invalid \s-1UTF\-8\s0 character sequences. Programs reading \fBTShark\fR output
should expect \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and be prepared for invalid output.
.PP
If \fBTShark\fR detects that it is writing to a \s-1TTY\s0 on \s-1UNIX\s0 or Linux and
the locale does not support \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 output will be re-encoded to match the
current locale.
.PP
If \fBTShark\fR detects that it is writing to the console on Windows,
dissection output will be encoded as \s-1UTF\-16LE.\s0 Other output will be
\&\s-1UTF\-8.\s0 If extended characters don't display properly in your terminal
you might try setting your console code page to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 (\fBchcp 65001\fR)
and using a modern terminal application if possible.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR"
This environment variable overrides the location of personal configuration
files. It defaults to \fI\f(CI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/wireshark\fR (or \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.wireshark\fR if
the former is missing while the latter exists). On Windows,
\&\fI\f(CI%APPDATA\fI%\eWireshark\fR is used instead. Available since Wireshark 3.0.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE"
Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for *all* allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See \fI\s-1README\s0.wmem\fR in the source distribution for
details.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY"
This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded
from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather than from the
standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in question is running
with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR"
This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.
.IP "\s-1ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK\s0" 4
.IX Item "ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK"
This environment variable controls the number of \s-1ERF\s0 records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the \s-1ERF\s0 format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.
.IP "\s-1IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK\s0" 4
.IX Item "IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK"
This environment variable controls the number of \s-1IPFIX\s0 records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the \s-1IPFIX\s0 format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG"
If this environment variable is set, \fBTShark\fR will call \fBabort\fR\|(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  \fBabort\fR\|(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running \fBTShark\fR in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS"
If this environment variable is set, \fBTShark\fR will call \fBabort\fR\|(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
\&\fBabort\fR\|(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
\&\fBTShark\fR in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.
