\&\fBWireshark\fR is a \s-1GUI\s0 network protocol analyzer.  It lets you
interactively browse packet data from a live network or from a
previously saved capture file.  \fBWireshark\fR's native capture file format
is \fBpcapng\fR format, or \fBpcap\fR which is also the format used by \fBtcpdump\fR and
various other tools.

.PP
There is no need to tell \fBWireshark\fR what type of
file you are reading; it will determine the file type by itself.
\&\fBWireshark\fR is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they
are compressed using gzip.  \fBWireshark\fR recognizes this directly from
the file; the '.gz' extension is not required for this purpose.
.PP
Like other protocol analyzers, \fBWireshark\fR's main window shows 3 views
of a packet.  It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the
packet is.  A packet details display is shown, allowing you to drill
down to exact protocol or field that you interested in.  Finally, a hex
dump shows you exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the
wire.
.PP
In addition, \fBWireshark\fR has some features that make it unique.  It can
assemble all the packets in a \s-1TCP\s0 conversation and show you the \s-1ASCII\s0
(or \s-1EBCDIC,\s0 or hex) data in that conversation.  Display filters in
\&\fBWireshark\fR are very powerful; more fields are filterable in \fBWireshark\fR
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to create
your filters is richer.  As \fBWireshark\fR progresses, expect more and more
protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.
.PP
Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.  This syntax is different
from the display filter syntax.
.PP
Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, \fBWireshark\fR will compile, but will
be unable to read compressed files.
.PP
The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
\&\fB\-r\fR option or can be specified as a command-line argument.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Most users will want to start \fBWireshark\fR without options and configure
it from the menus instead.  Those users may just skip this section.
.IP "\-a|\-\-autostop  <capture autostop condition>" 4
.IX Item "-a|--autostop <capture autostop condition>"
Specify a criterion that specifies when \fBWireshark\fR is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form \fItest\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
where \fItest\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBduration\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after \fIvalue\fR seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.Sp
\&\fBfiles\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to capture files after \fIvalue\fR number of files
were written.
.Sp
\&\fBfilesize\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
\&\fIvalue\fR kB.  If this option is used together with the \-b option, Wireshark
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of
2 GiB.
.Sp
\&\fBpackets\fR:\fIvalue\fR Stop writing to a capture file after it contains \fIvalue\fR
packets. Same as \fB\-c\fR<capture packet count>.
.IP "\-b|\-\-ring\-buffer  <capture ring buffer option>" 4
.IX Item "-b|--ring-buffer <capture ring buffer option>"
Cause \fBWireshark\fR to run in \*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode.  In \*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode,
\&\fBWireshark\fR will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, \fBWireshark\fR will switch writing to the next file and so on.
.Sp
The created filenames are based on the filename given with the \fB\-w\fR flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20200714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20200714120523.pcap, ...
.Sp
With the \fIfiles\fR option it's also possible to form a \*(L"ring buffer\*(R".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point \fBWireshark\fR will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the \fIfiles\fR option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).
.Sp
The criterion is of the form \fIkey\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
where \fIkey\fR is one of:
.Sp
\&\fBduration\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after \fIvalue\fR seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.
.Sp
\&\fBfiles\fR:\fIvalue\fR begin again with the first file after \fIvalue\fR number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The \fBfiles\fR criterion
requires one of the other criteria to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each \fB\-b\fR
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
preceded by the \fB\-b\fR option.
.Sp
\&\fBfilesize\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
\&\fIvalue\fR kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 GiB.
.Sp
\&\fBinterval\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of \fIvalue\fR seconds.
.Sp
\&\fBpackets\fR:\fIvalue\fR switch to the next file after it contains \fIvalue\fR
packets.
.Sp
Example: \fB\-b filesize:1000 \-b files:5\fR results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte each.
.IP "\-B|\-\-buffer\-size  <capture buffer size>" 4
.IX Item "-B|--buffer-size <capture buffer size>"
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while \fBWireshark\fR attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you're capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.
.Sp
This is available on \s-1UNIX\s0 systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or later and on
Windows.  It is not available on \s-1UNIX\s0 systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.
.IP "\-c  <capture packet count>" 4
.IX Item "-c <capture packet count>"
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data. Same as \fB\-a packets:\fR<capture packet count>.
.IP "\-C  <configuration profile>" 4
.IX Item "-C <configuration profile>"
Start with the given configuration profile.
.IP "\-\-capture\-comment <comment>" 4
.IX Item "--capture-comment <comment>"
Set the capture file comment, if supported by the capture format.
.IP "\-d  <layer type>==<selector>,<decode\-as protocol>" 4
.IX Item "-d <layer type>==<selector>,<decode-as protocol>"
Like Wireshark's \fBDecode As...\fR feature, this lets you specify how a
layer type should be dissected.  If the layer type in question (for example,
\&\fBtcp.port\fR or \fBudp.port\fR for a \s-1TCP\s0 or \s-1UDP\s0 port number) has the specified
selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.
.Sp
Example: \fB\-d tcp.port==8888,http\fR will decode any traffic running over
\&\s-1TCP\s0 port 8888 as \s-1HTTP.\s0
.Sp
See the \fBtshark\fR\|(1) manual page for more examples.
.IP "\-D|\-\-list\-interfaces" 4
.IX Item "-D|--list-interfaces"
Print a list of the interfaces on which \fBWireshark\fR can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the \fB\-i\fR flag to specify an interface on which to capture.
.Sp
This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(\s-1UNIX\s0 systems lacking \fBifconfig \-a\fR or Linux systems lacking
\&\fBip link show\fR). The number can be useful on Windows systems, where
the interface name might be a long name or a \s-1GUID.\s0
.Sp
Note that \*(L"can capture\*(R" means that \fBWireshark\fR was able to open
that device to do a live capture; if, on your system, a program doing a
network capture must be run from an account with special privileges (for
example, as root), then, if \fBWireshark\fR is run with the \fB\-D\fR flag and
is not run from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.
.IP "\-\-display <X display to use>" 4
.IX Item "--display <X display to use>"
Specifies the X display to use.  A hostname and screen (otherhost:0.0)
or just a screen (:0.0) can be specified.  This option is not available
under Windows.
.IP "\-\-disable\-protocol <proto_name>" 4
.IX Item "--disable-protocol <proto_name>"
Disable dissection of proto_name.
.IP "\-\-disable\-heuristic <short_name>" 4
.IX Item "--disable-heuristic <short_name>"
Disable dissection of heuristic protocol.
.IP "\-\-enable\-protocol <proto_name>" 4
.IX Item "--enable-protocol <proto_name>"
Enable dissection of proto_name.
.IP "\-\-enable\-heuristic <short_name>" 4
.IX Item "--enable-heuristic <short_name>"
Enable dissection of heuristic protocol.
.IP "\-f  <capture filter>" 4
.IX Item "-f <capture filter>"
Set the capture filter expression.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.
.Sp
Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the \s-1GUI\s0 menu item Capture\->Capture Filters,
can be used by prefixing the argument with \*(L"predef:\*(R".
Example: \fB\-f \*(L"predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter\*(R"\fR
.IP "\-\-fullscreen" 4
.IX Item "--fullscreen"
Start Wireshark in full screen mode (kiosk mode). To exit from fullscreen mode,
open the View menu and select the Full Screen option. Alternatively, press the
F11 key (or Ctrl + Cmd + F for macOS).
.IP "\-g  <packet number>" 4
.IX Item "-g <packet number>"
After reading in a capture file using the \fB\-r\fR flag, go to the given \fIpacket number\fR.
.IP "\-h|\-\-help" 4
.IX Item "-h|--help"
Print the version number and options and exit.
.IP "\-H" 4
.IX Item "-H"
Hide the capture info dialog during live packet capture.
.IP "\-i|\-\-interface  <capture interface>|\-" 4
.IX Item "-i|--interface <capture interface>|-"
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.
.Sp
Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
"\fBwireshark \-D\fR\*(L" (described above); a number, as reported by
\&\*(R"\fBwireshark \-D\fR\*(L", can also be used.  If you're using \s-1UNIX, \*(R"\s0\fBnetstat
\&\-i\fR\*(L", \*(R"\fBifconfig \-a\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\fBip link\fR" might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of \s-1UNIX\s0 support the \fB\-a\fR flag to \fBifconfig\fR.
.Sp
If no interface is specified, \fBWireshark\fR searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
\&\fBWireshark\fR reports an error and doesn't start the capture.
.Sp
Pipe names should be either the name of a \s-1FIFO\s0 (named pipe) or \*(L"\-\*(R" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\e\epipe\e.\e\fBpipename\fR".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple
interfaces, the capture file will be saved in pcapng format.
.IP "\-I|\-\-monitor\-mode" 4
.IX Item "-I|--monitor-mode"
Put the interface in \*(L"monitor mode\*(R"; this is supported only on \s-1IEEE
802.11\s0 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.
.Sp
Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.
.Sp
This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the \fB\-i\fR option, it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces.
If used after an \fB\-i\fR option, it enables the monitor mode for
the interface specified by the last \fB\-i\fR option occurring before
this option.
.IP "\-j" 4
.IX Item "-j"
Use after \fB\-J\fR to change the behavior when no exact match is found for
the filter.  With this option select the first packet before.
.IP "\-J  <jump filter>" 4
.IX Item "-J <jump filter>"
After reading in a capture file using the \fB\-r\fR flag, jump to the packet
matching the filter (display filter syntax).  If no exact match is found
the first packet after that is selected.
.IP "\-k" 4
.IX Item "-k"
Start the capture session immediately.  If the \fB\-i\fR flag was
specified, the capture uses the specified interface.  Otherwise,
\&\fBWireshark\fR searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first
non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and
choosing the first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback
interfaces; if there are no interfaces, \fBWireshark\fR reports an error and
doesn't start the capture.
.IP "\-K  <keytab>" 4
.IX Item "-K <keytab>"
Load kerberos crypto keys from the specified keytab file.
This option can be used multiple times to load keys from several files.
.Sp
Example: \fB\-K krb5.keytab\fR
.IP "\-l" 4
.IX Item "-l"
Turn on automatic scrolling if the packet display is being updated
automatically as packets arrive during a capture (as specified by the
\&\fB\-S\fR flag).
.IP "\-L|\-\-list\-data\-link\-types" 4

Set a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and any value
read from a preference/recent file.  The argument to the flag is a string of
the form \fIprefname\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR, where \fIprefname\fR is the name of the
preference/recent value (which is the same name that would appear in the
preference/recent file), and \fIvalue\fR is the value to which it should be set.
Since \fBEthereal\fR 0.10.12, the recent settings replaces the formerly used
\&\-B, \-P and \-T flags to manipulate the \s-1GUI\s0 dimensions.

Save the current capture, or the packets currently displayed from that
capture, to a file.  Check boxes let you select whether to save all
packets, or just those that have passed the current display filter and/or
those that are currently marked, and an option menu lets you select (from
a list of file formats in which at particular capture, or the packets
currently displayed from that capture, can be saved), a file format in
which to save it.
.IP "File:File Set:List Files" 4
.IX Item "File:File Set:List Files"
Show a dialog box that lists all files of the file set matching the currently
loaded file.  A file set is a compound of files resulting from a capture using
the \*(L"multiple files\*(R" / \*(L"ringbuffer\*(R" mode, recognizable by the filename pattern,
e.g.: Filename_00001_20200714101530.pcap.

.IP "File:Print" 4
.IX Item "File:Print"
Print packet data from the current capture.  You can select the range of
packets to be printed (which packets are printed), and the output format of
each packet (how each packet is printed).  The output format will be similar
to the displayed values, so a summary line, the packet details view, and/or
the hex dump of the packet can be printed.

.IP "Edit:Copy:As Filter" 4
.IX Item "Edit:Copy:As Filter"
Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details and copy that filter to the clipboard.
.Sp
If that data is a field that can be tested in a display filter
expression, the display filter will test that field; otherwise, the
display filter will be based on the absolute offset within the packet.
Therefore it could be unreliable if the packet contains protocols with
variable-length headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.
.IP "Edit:Find Packet" 4
.IX Item "Edit:Find Packet"
Search forward or backward, starting with the currently selected packet
(or the most recently selected packet, if no packet is selected).  Search
criteria can be a display filter expression, a string of hexadecimal
digits, or a text string.
.Sp
When searching for a text string, you can search the packet data, or you
can search the text in the Info column in the packet list pane or in the
packet details pane.

.IX Item "Edit:Time Reference:Set Time Reference (toggle)"
Set (or unset if currently set) the selected packet as a Time Reference packet.
When a packet is set as a Time Reference packet, the timestamps in the packet
list pane will be replaced with the string \*(L"*REF*\*(R".
The relative time timestamp in later packets will then be calculated relative
to the timestamp of this Time Reference packet and not the first packet in
the capture.
.Sp
Packets that have been selected as Time Reference packets will always be
displayed in the packet list pane.  Display filters will not affect or
hide these packets.

.IX Item "View:Coloring Rules"
Change the foreground and background colors of the packet information in
the list of packets, based upon display filters.  The list of display
filters is applied to each packet sequentially.  After the first display
filter matches a packet, any additional display filters in the list are
ignored.  Therefore, if you are filtering on the existence of protocols,
you should list the higher-level protocols first, and the lower-level
protocols last.
.RS 4
.IP "How Colorization Works" 4
.IX Item "How Colorization Works"
Packets are colored according to a list of color filters.  Each filter
consists of a name, a filter expression and a coloration.  A packet is
colored according to the first filter that it matches.  Color filter
expressions use exactly the same syntax as display filter expressions.
.Sp
When Wireshark starts, the color filters are loaded from:

to hold the capture.  The location of the file can be chosen by setting your
\&\s-1TMPDIR\s0 environment variable before starting \fBWireshark\fR.  Otherwise, the
default \s-1TMPDIR\s0 location is system-dependent, but is likely either \fI/var/tmp\fR

.IP "Analyze:Apply as Filter" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Apply as Filter"
Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details and apply the filter.
.Sp
If that data is a field that can be tested in a display filter
expression, the display filter will test that field; otherwise, the
display filter will be based on the absolute offset within the packet.
Therefore it could be unreliable if the packet contains protocols with
variable-length headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.
.Sp
The \fBSelected\fR option creates a display filter that tests for a match
of the data; the \fBNot Selected\fR option creates a display filter that
tests for a non-match of the data.  The \fBAnd Selected\fR, \fBOr Selected\fR,
\&\fBAnd Not Selected\fR, and \fBOr Not Selected\fR options add to the end of
the display filter in the strip at the top (or bottom) an \s-1AND\s0 or \s-1OR\s0
operator followed by the new display filter expression.
.IP "Analyze:Prepare as Filter" 4

.IP "Analyze:Enabled Protocols" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Enabled Protocols"
Allow protocol dissection to be enabled or disabled for a specific
protocol.  Individual protocols can be enabled or disabled by clicking
on them in the list or by highlighting them and pressing the space bar.
The entire list can be enabled, disabled, or inverted using the buttons
below the list.
.Sp
When a protocol is disabled, dissection in a particular packet stops
when that protocol is reached, and Wireshark moves on to the next packet.
Any higher-layer protocols that would otherwise have been processed will
not be displayed.  For example, disabling \s-1TCP\s0 will prevent the dissection
and display of \s-1TCP, HTTP, SMTP,\s0 Telnet, and any other protocol exclusively
dependent on \s-1TCP.\s0
.Sp
The list of protocols can be saved, so that Wireshark will start up with
the protocols in that list disabled.
.IP "Analyze:Decode As" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:Decode As"
If you have a packet selected, present a dialog allowing you to change
which dissectors are used to decode this packet.  The dialog has one
panel each for the link layer, network layer and transport layer
protocol/port numbers, and will allow each of these to be changed
independently.  For example, if the selected packet is a \s-1TCP\s0 packet to
port 12345, using this dialog you can instruct Wireshark to decode all
packets to or from that \s-1TCP\s0 port as \s-1HTTP\s0 packets.
.IP "Analyze:User Specified Decodes" 4
.IX Item "Analyze:User Specified Decodes"
Create a new window showing whether any protocol \s-1ID\s0 to dissector

.IX Item "Analyze:Follow TCP Stream"
If you have a \s-1TCP\s0 packet selected, display the contents of the data
stream for the \s-1TCP\s0 connection to which that packet belongs, as text, in
a separate window, and leave the list of packets in a filtered state,
with only those packets that are part of that \s-1TCP\s0 connection being
displayed.  You can revert to your old view by pressing \s-1ENTER\s0 in the
display filter text box, thereby invoking your old display filter (or
resetting it back to no display filter).

hierarchy in which they were found in the trace.  Besides counting the
packets in which the protocol exists, a count is also made for packets
in which the protocol is the last protocol in the stack.  These
last-protocol counts show you how many packets (and the byte count
associated with those packets) \fBended\fR in a particular protocol.  In
the table, they are listed under \*(L"End Packets\*(R" and \*(L"End Bytes\*(R".

.IX Item "Statistics:I/O Graphs"
Open a window where up to 5 graphs in different colors can be displayed
to indicate number of packets or number of bytes per second for all packets
matching the specified filter.
By default only one graph will be displayed showing number of packets per second.
.Sp
The top part of the window contains the graphs and scales for the X and
Y axis.  If the graph is too long to fit inside the window there is a
horizontal scrollbar below the drawing area that can scroll the graphs
to the left or the right.  The horizontal axis displays the time into
the capture and the vertical axis will display the measured quantity at
that time.
.Sp
Below the drawing area and the scrollbar are the controls.  On the
bottom left there will be five similar sets of controls to control each
individual graph such as \*(L"Display:<button>\*(R" which button will toggle
that individual graph on/off.  If <button> is ticked, the graph will be
displayed. \*(L"Color:<color>\*(R" which is just a button to show which color
will be used to draw that graph. Finally \*(L"Filter:<filter\-text>\*(R" which
can be used to specify a display filter for that particular graph.
.Sp
If filter-text is empty then all packets will be used to calculate the
quantity for that graph.  If filter-text is specified only those packets
that match that display filter will be considered in the calculation of
quantity.
.Sp
To the right of the 5 graph controls there are four menus to control
global aspects of the draw area and graphs.  The \*(L"Unit:\*(R" menu is used to
control what to measure; \*(L"packets/tick\*(R", \*(L"bytes/tick\*(R" or \*(L"advanced...\*(R"
.Sp
packets/tick will measure the number of packets matching the (if
specified) display filter for the graph in each measurement interval.
.Sp
bytes/tick will measure the total number of bytes in all packets matching
the (if specified) display filter for the graph in each measurement
interval.
.Sp
advanced... see below
.Sp
\&\*(L"Tick interval:\*(R" specifies what measurement intervals to use.  The
default is 1 second and means that the data will be counted over 1
second intervals.
.Sp
\&\*(L"Pixels per tick:\*(R" specifies how many pixels wide each measurement
interval will be in the drawing area.  The default is 5 pixels per tick.
.Sp
\&\*(L"Y\-scale:\*(R" controls the max value for the y\-axis.  Default value is
\&\*(L"auto\*(R" which means that \fBWireshark\fR will try to adjust the maxvalue
automatically.
.Sp
\&\*(L"advanced...\*(R" If Unit:advanced...  is selected the window will display
two more controls for each of the five graphs.  One control will be a
menu where the type of calculation can be selected from
\&\s-1SUM,COUNT,MAX,MIN,AVG\s0 and \s-1LOAD,\s0 and one control, textbox, where the name of a
single display filter field can be specified.
.Sp
The following restrictions apply to type and field combinations:
.Sp
\&\s-1SUM:\s0 available for all types of integers and will calculate the \s-1SUM\s0 of
all occurrences of this field in the measurement interval.  Note that
some field can occur multiple times in the same packet and then all
instances will be summed up.  Example: 'tcp.len' which will count the
amount of payload data transferred across \s-1TCP\s0 in each interval.
.Sp
\&\s-1COUNT:\s0 available for all field types.  This will \s-1COUNT\s0 the number of times
certain field occurs in each interval.  Note that some fields
may occur multiple times in each packet and if that is the case
then each instance will be counted independently and \s-1COUNT\s0
will be greater than the number of packets.
.Sp
\&\s-1MAX:\s0 available for all integer and relative time fields.  This will calculate
the max seen integer/time value seen for the field during the interval.
Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the maximum \s-1SMB\s0 response time.
.Sp
\&\s-1MIN:\s0 available for all integer and relative time fields.  This will calculate
the min seen integer/time value seen for the field during the interval.
Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the minimum \s-1SMB\s0 response time.
.Sp
\&\s-1AVG:\s0 available for all integer and relative time fields.This will
calculate the average seen integer/time value seen for the field during
the interval.  Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the average \s-1SMB\s0
response time.
.Sp
\&\s-1LOAD:\s0 available only for relative time fields (response times).
.Sp
Example of advanced:
Display how \s-1NFS\s0 response time \s-1MAX/MIN/AVG\s0 changes over time:

.Sp
\&\s-1LOAD:\s0
The \s-1LOAD\s0 io-stat type is very different from anything you have ever seen
before! While the response times themselves as plotted by \s-1MIN,MAX,AVG\s0 are
indications on the Server load (which affects the Server response time),
the \s-1LOAD\s0 measurement measures the Client \s-1LOAD.\s0
What this measures is how much workload the client generates,
i.e. how fast will the client issue new commands when the previous ones
completed.
i.e. the level of concurrency the client can maintain.
The higher the number, the more and faster is the client issuing new
commands.  When the \s-1LOAD\s0 goes down, it may be due to client load making
the client slower in issuing new commands (there may be other reasons as
well, maybe the client just doesn't have any commands it wants to issue
right then).
.Sp
Load is measured in concurrency/number of overlapping i/o and the value
1000 means there is a constant load of one i/o.
.Sp
In each tick interval the amount of overlap is measured.
See the graph below containing three commands:
Below the graph are the \s-1LOAD\s0 values for each interval that would be calculated.

(you must have sufficient permissions to write this file, of course).
.IP "\s-1IMPORT\s0" 4
.IX Item "IMPORT"
Allows you to choose a file containing color filters which are then
added to the bottom of the current list.  All the added filters are
selected, so they may be moved to the correct position in the list as a
group.  To avoid confusion, all filters are unselected before the new
filters are imported.  A button is provided to load the filters from the
global color filters file.
.IP "\s-1CLEAR\s0" 4
.IX Item "CLEAR"
Deletes your personal color filters file, reloads the global
color filters file, if any, and closes the dialog.
.IP "\s-1UP\s0" 4
.IX Item "UP"
Moves the selected filter(s) up the list, making it more likely that
they will be used to color packets.
.IP "\s-1DOWN\s0" 4
.IX Item "DOWN"
Moves the selected filter(s) down the list, making it less likely that
they will be used to color packets.

.IP "Capture Options Dialog" 4
.IX Item "Capture Options Dialog"
The \fICapture Options Dialog\fR lets you specify various parameters for
capturing live packet data.
.Sp
The \fIInterface:\fR field lets you specify the interface from which to
capture packet data or a command from which to get the packet data via a
pipe.
.Sp
The \fILink layer header type:\fR field lets you specify the interfaces link
layer header type.  This field is usually disabled, as most interface have
only one header type.
.Sp
The \fICapture packets in promiscuous mode\fR check box lets you specify
whether the interface should be put into promiscuous mode when
capturing.
.Sp
The \fILimit each packet to ... bytes\fR check box and field lets you
specify a maximum number of bytes per packet to capture and save; if the
check box is not checked, the limit will be 262144 bytes.
.Sp
The \fICapture Filter:\fR entry lets you specify the capture filter using a
tcpdump-style filter string as described above.
.Sp
The \fIFile:\fR entry lets you specify the file into which captured packets
should be saved, as in the \fIPrinter Options\fR dialog above.  If not
specified, the captured packets will be saved in a temporary file; you
can save those packets to a file with the \fIFile:Save As\fR menu item.
.Sp
The \fIUse multiple files\fR check box lets you specify that the capture
should be done in \*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode.  This option is disabled, if the
\&\fIUpdate list of packets in real time\fR option is checked.
.Sp
The \fINext file every ...  megabyte(s)\fR check box and fields lets
you specify that a switch to a next file should be done
if the specified filesize is reached.  You can also select the appropriate
unit, but beware that the filesize has a maximum of 2 GiB.
The check box is forced to be checked, as \*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode requires a
file size to be specified.
.Sp
The \fINext file every ... minute(s)\fR check box and fields lets
you specify that the switch to a next file should be done after the specified
time has elapsed, even if the specified capture size is not reached.
.Sp
The \fIRing buffer with ... files\fR field lets you specify the number
of files of a ring buffer.  This feature will capture into the first file
again, after the specified number of files have been used.
.Sp
The \fIStop capture after ... files\fR field lets you specify the number
of capture files used, until the capture is stopped.
.Sp
The \fIStop capture after ... packet(s)\fR check box and field let
you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after having captured
some number of packets; if the check box is not checked, Wireshark will
not stop capturing at some fixed number of captured packets.
.Sp
The \fIStop capture after ... megabyte(s)\fR check box and field lets
you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after the file to which
captured packets are being saved grows as large as or larger than some
specified number of megabytes.  If the check box is not checked, Wireshark
will not stop capturing at some capture file size (although the operating
system on which Wireshark is running, or the available disk space, may still
limit the maximum size of a capture file).  This option is disabled, if
\&\*(L"multiple files\*(R" mode is used,
.Sp
The \fIStop capture after ...  second(s)\fR check box and field let you
specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after it has been capturing
for some number of seconds; if the check box is not checked, Wireshark
will not stop capturing after some fixed time has elapsed.
.Sp
The \fIUpdate list of packets in real time\fR check box lets you specify
whether the display should be updated as packets are captured and, if
you specify that, the \fIAutomatic scrolling in live capture\fR check box
lets you specify the packet list pane should automatically scroll to
show the most recently captured packets as new packets arrive.
.Sp
The \fIEnable \s-1MAC\s0 name resolution\fR, \fIEnable network name resolution\fR and
\&\fIEnable transport name resolution\fR check boxes let you specify whether
\&\s-1MAC\s0 addresses, network addresses, and transport-layer port numbers
should be translated to names.
.IP "About" 4
.IX Item "About"
The \fIAbout\fR dialog lets you view various information about Wireshark.
.IP "About:Wireshark" 4
.IX Item "About:Wireshark"
The \fIWireshark\fR page lets you view general information about Wireshark,
like the installed version, licensing information and such.
.IP "About:Authors" 4
.IX Item "About:Authors"
The \fIAuthors\fR page shows the author and all contributors.
.IP "About:Folders" 4
.IX Item "About:Folders"
The \fIFolders\fR page lets you view the directory names where Wireshark is
searching it's various configuration and other files.
.IP "About:Plugins" 4
.IX Item "About:Plugins"
The \fIPlugins\fR page lets you view the dissector plugin modules
available on your system.
.Sp
The \fIPlugins List\fR shows the name and version of each dissector plugin
module found on your system.
.Sp
On Unix-compatible systems, the plugins are looked for in the following
directories: the \fIlib/wireshark/plugins/$VERSION\fR directory under the
main installation directory (for example,
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/$VERSION\fR), and then
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.wireshark/plugins\fR.
.Sp
On Windows systems, the plugins are looked for in the following
directories: \fIplugins\e$VERSION\fR directory under the main installation
directory (for example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\eplugins\e$VERSION\fR),
and then \fI\f(CI%APPDATA\fI%\eWireshark\eplugins\e$VERSION\fR (or, if \f(CW%APPDATA\fR% isn't
defined, \fI\f(CI%USERPROFILE\fI%\eApplication Data\eWireshark\eplugins\e$VERSION\fR).
.Sp
\&\f(CW$VERSION\fR is the version number of the plugin interface, which
is typically the version number of Wireshark.  Note that a dissector
plugin module may support more than one protocol; there is not
necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between dissector plugin modules
and protocols.  Protocols supported by a dissector plugin module are
enabled and disabled using the \fIEdit:Protocols\fR dialog box, just as
protocols built into Wireshark are.
.SH "CAPTURE FILTER SYNTAX"
.IX Header "CAPTURE FILTER SYNTAX"

.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
These files contains various \fBWireshark\fR configuration settings.
.IP "Preferences" 4
.IX Item "Preferences"
The \fIpreferences\fR files contain global (system-wide) and personal
preference settings.  If the system-wide preference file exists, it is
read first, overriding the default settings.  If the personal preferences
file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous values.  Note: If
the command line flag \fB\-o\fR is used (possibly more than once), it will
in turn override values from the preferences files.
.Sp
The preferences settings are in the form \fIprefname\fR\fB:\fR\fIvalue\fR,
one per line,
where \fIprefname\fR is the name of the preference
and \fIvalue\fR is the value to
which it should be set; white space is allowed between \fB:\fR and
\&\fIvalue\fR.  A preference setting can be continued on subsequent lines by
indenting the continuation lines with white space.  A \fB#\fR character
starts a comment that runs to the end of the line:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  # Vertical scrollbars should be on right side?
\&  # TRUE or FALSE (case\-insensitive).
\&  gui.scrollbar_on_right: TRUE
.Ve
.Sp
The global preferences file is looked for in the \fIwireshark\fR directory
under the \fIshare\fR subdirectory of the main installation directory (for
example, \fI/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences\fR) on UNIX-compatible
systems, and in the main installation directory (for example,
\&\fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\epreferences\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal preferences file is looked for in
\&\fI\f(CI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/wireshark/preferences\fR
(or, if \fI\f(CI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fI/wireshark\fR does not exist while \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.wireshark\fR
is present, \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.wireshark/preferences\fR) on
UNIX-compatible systems and \fI\f(CI%APPDATA\fI%\eWireshark\epreferences\fR (or, if
\&\f(CW%APPDATA\fR% isn't defined, \fI\f(CI%USERPROFILE\fI%\eApplication
Data\eWireshark\epreferences\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
Note: Whenever the preferences are saved by using the \fISave\fR button
in the \fIEdit:Preferences\fR dialog box, your personal preferences file
will be overwritten with the new settings, destroying any comments and
unknown/obsolete settings that were in the file.
.IP "Recent" 4
.IX Item "Recent"
The \fIrecent\fR file contains personal settings (mostly \s-1GUI\s0 related) such
as the current \fBWireshark\fR window size.  The file is saved at program exit and
read in at program start automatically.  Note: The command line flag \fB\-o\fR
may be used to override settings from this file.
.Sp
The settings in this file have the same format as in the \fIpreferences\fR
files, and the same directory as for the personal preferences file is
used.
.Sp
Note: Whenever Wireshark is closed, your recent file
will be overwritten with the new settings, destroying any comments and
unknown/obsolete settings that were in the file.
.IP "Disabled (Enabled) Protocols" 4
.IX Item "Disabled (Enabled) Protocols"
The \fIdisabled_protos\fR files contain system-wide and personal lists of
protocols that have been disabled, so that their dissectors are never
called.  The files contain protocol names, one per line, where the
protocol name is the same name that would be used in a display filter
for the protocol:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  http
\&  tcp     # a comment
.Ve
.Sp
If a protocol is listed in the global \fIdisabled_protos\fR file, it is not
displayed in the \fIAnalyze:Enabled Protocols\fR dialog box, and so cannot
be enabled by the user.
.Sp
The global \fIdisabled_protos\fR file uses the same directory as the global
preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIdisabled_protos\fR file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.
.Sp
Note: Whenever the disabled protocols list is saved by using the \fISave\fR
button in the \fIAnalyze:Enabled Protocols\fR dialog box, your personal
disabled protocols file will be overwritten with the new settings,
destroying any comments that were in the file.
.IP "Name Resolution (hosts)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (hosts)"
If the personal \fIhosts\fR file exists, it is
used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before any other
attempts are made to resolve them.  The file has the standard \fIhosts\fR
file syntax; each line contains one \s-1IP\s0 address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The same directory as for the personal preferences file is used.
.Sp
Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal \fIhosts\fR file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.
.IP "Name Resolution (subnets)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (subnets)"
If an IPv4 address cannot be translated via name resolution (no exact
match is found) then a partial match is attempted via the \fIsubnets\fR file.
Both the global \fIsubnets\fR file and personal \fIsubnets\fR files are used
if they exist.
.Sp
Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length
separated only by a / and a name separated by whitespace. While the address
must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the mask length are subsequently
ignored.
.Sp
An example is:
.Sp
# Comments must be prepended by the # sign!
192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network
.Sp
A partially matched name will be printed as \*(L"subnet\-name.remaining\-address\*(R".
For example, \*(L"192.168.0.1\*(R" under the subnet above would be printed as
\&\*(L"ws_test_network.1\*(R"; if the mask length above had been 16 rather than 24, the
printed address would be ``ws_test_network.0.1".
.IP "Name Resolution (ethers)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (ethers)"
The \fIethers\fR files are consulted to correlate 6\-byte hardware addresses to
names.  First the personal \fIethers\fR file is tried and if an address is not
found there the global \fIethers\fR file is tried next.
.Sp
Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The digits of the hardware address are separated by colons
(:), dashes (\-) or periods (.).  The same separator character must be
used consistently in an address.  The following three lines are valid
lines of an \fIethers\fR file:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
\&  c0\-00\-ff\-ff\-ff\-ff          TR_broadcast
\&  00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIethers\fR file is looked for in the \fI/etc\fR directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal \fIethers\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the personal
preferences file.
.Sp
Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal \fIethers\fR file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.
.IP "Name Resolution (manuf)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (manuf)"
The \fImanuf\fR file is used to match the 3\-byte vendor portion of a 6\-byte
hardware address with the manufacturer's name; it can also contain well-known
\&\s-1MAC\s0 addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask.  The format of the
file is the same as the \fIethers\fR files, except that entries such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  00:00:0C      Cisco
.Ve
.Sp
can be provided, with the 3\-byte \s-1OUI\s0 and the name for a vendor, and
entries such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC/40     All\-HSRP\-routers
.Ve
.Sp
can be specified, with a \s-1MAC\s0 address and a mask indicating how many bits
of the address must match.  The above entry, for example, has 40
significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC\-00 through 00\-00\-0C\-07\-AC\-FF.  The mask need not be a
multiple of 8.
.Sp
The \fImanuf\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the global
preferences file.
.IP "Name Resolution (services)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (services)"
The \fIservices\fR file is used to translate port numbers into names.
Both the global \fIservices\fR file and personal \fIservices\fR files are used
if they exist.
.Sp
The file has the standard \fIservices\fR file syntax; each line contains one
(service) name and one transport identifier separated by white space.  The
transport identifier includes one port number and one transport protocol name
(typically tcp, udp, or sctp) separated by a /.
.Sp
An example is:
.Sp
mydns       5045/udp     # My own Domain Name Server
mydns       5045/tcp     # My own Domain Name Server
.IP "Name Resolution (ipxnets)" 4
.IX Item "Name Resolution (ipxnets)"
The \fIipxnets\fR files are used to correlate 4\-byte \s-1IPX\s0 network numbers to
names.  First the global \fIipxnets\fR file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.
.Sp
The format is the same as the \fIethers\fR
file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal
number, as is more common in the \s-1IPX\s0 world, rather than four hex octets.
For example, these four lines are valid lines of an \fIipxnets\fR file:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  C0.A8.2C.00              HR
\&  c0\-a8\-1c\-00              CEO
\&  00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
\&  110f                     FileServer3
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIipxnets\fR file is looked for in the \fI/etc\fR directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, \fIC:\eProgram Files\eWireshark\fR) on Windows systems.
.Sp
The personal \fIipxnets\fR file is looked for in the same directory as the
personal preferences file.
.IP "Capture Filters" 4
.IX Item "Capture Filters"
The \fIcfilters\fR files contain system-wide and personal capture filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  "HTTP" port 80
\&  "DCERPC" port 135
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIcfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIcfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the personal
preferences file.  It is written through the Capture:Capture Filters
dialog.
.Sp
If the global \fIcfilters\fR file exists, it is used only if the personal
\&\fIcfilters\fR file does not exist; global and personal capture filters are
not merged.
.IP "Display Filters" 4
.IX Item "Display Filters"
The \fIdfilters\fR files contain system-wide and personal display filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  "HTTP" http
\&  "DCERPC" dcerpc
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIdfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIdfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.  It is written through the Analyze:Display
Filters dialog.
.Sp
If the global \fIdfilters\fR file exists, it is used only if the personal
\&\fIdfilters\fR file does not exist; global and personal display filters are
not merged.
.IP "Color Filters (Coloring Rules)" 4
.IX Item "Color Filters (Coloring Rules)"
The \fIcolorfilters\fR files contain system-wide and personal color filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box, followed by the corresponding display filter.  Then the
background and foreground colors are appended:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  # a comment
\&  @tcp@tcp@[59345,58980,65534][0,0,0]
\&  @udp@udp@[28834,57427,65533][0,0,0]
.Ve
.Sp
The global \fIcolorfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.
.Sp
The personal \fIcolorfilters\fR file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.  It is written through the View:Coloring Rules
dialog.
.Sp
If the global \fIcolorfilters\fR file exists, it is used only if the personal

.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE"
Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the

backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See \fI\s-1README\s0.wmem\fR in the source distribution for
details.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY"
This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded

.IP "\s-1ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK\s0" 4
.IX Item "ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK"
This environment variable controls the number of \s-1ERF\s0 records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the \s-1ERF\s0 format.  Setting this environment

less likely.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG"
If this environment variable is set, \fBWireshark\fR will call \fBabort\fR\|(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  \fBabort\fR\|(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running \fBWireshark\fR in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.
.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS"
If this environment variable is set, \fBWireshark\fR will call \fBabort\fR\|(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
\&\fBabort\fR\|(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running

.IP "\s-1WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE\s0" 4
.IX Item "WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE"
Cause \fBWireshark\fR to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn't automatically start a capture; you must still use \fB\-k\fR to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-a
