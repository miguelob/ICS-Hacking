=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Wireshark> is a GUI network protocol analyzer.  It lets you
interactively browse packet data from a live network or from a
previously saved capture file.  B<Wireshark>'s native capture file format
is B<pcapng> format, or B<pcap> which is also the format used by B<tcpdump> and
various other tools.

B<Wireshark> can read / import the following file formats:

There is no need to tell B<Wireshark> what type of
file you are reading; it will determine the file type by itself.
B<Wireshark> is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they
are compressed using gzip.  B<Wireshark> recognizes this directly from
the file; the '.gz' extension is not required for this purpose.

Like other protocol analyzers, B<Wireshark>'s main window shows 3 views
of a packet.  It shows a summary line, briefly describing what the
packet is.  A packet details display is shown, allowing you to drill
down to exact protocol or field that you interested in.  Finally, a hex
dump shows you exactly what the packet looks like when it goes over the
wire.

In addition, B<Wireshark> has some features that make it unique.  It can
assemble all the packets in a TCP conversation and show you the ASCII
(or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation.  Display filters in
B<Wireshark> are very powerful; more fields are filterable in B<Wireshark>
than in other protocol analyzers, and the syntax you can use to create
your filters is richer.  As B<Wireshark> progresses, expect more and more
protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.

Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library.  The capture filter
syntax follows the rules of the pcap library.  This syntax is different
from the display filter syntax.

Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library.
If the zlib library is not present, B<Wireshark> will compile, but will
be unable to read compressed files.

The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the
B<-r> option or can be specified as a command-line argument.

=head1 OPTIONS

Most users will want to start B<Wireshark> without options and configure
it from the menus instead.  Those users may just skip this section.

=over 4

=item -a|--autostop  E<lt>capture autostop conditionE<gt>

Specify a criterion that specifies when B<Wireshark> is to stop writing
to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form I<test>B<:>I<value>,
where I<test> is one of:

B<duration>:I<value> Stop writing to a capture file after I<value> seconds have
elapsed. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

B<files>:I<value> Stop writing to capture files after I<value> number of files
were written.

B<filesize>:I<value> Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of
I<value> kB.  If this option is used together with the -b option, Wireshark
will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if
filesize is reached.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of
2 GiB.

B<packets>:I<value> Stop writing to a capture file after it contains I<value>
packets. Same as B<-c>E<lt>capture packet countE<gt>.

=item -b|--ring-buffer  E<lt>capture ring buffer optionE<gt>

Cause B<Wireshark> to run in "multiple files" mode.  In "multiple files" mode,
B<Wireshark> will write to several capture files.  When the first capture file
fills up, B<Wireshark> will switch writing to the next file and so on.

The created filenames are based on the filename given with the B<-w> flag,
the number of the file and on the creation date and time,
e.g. outfile_00001_20200714120117.pcap, outfile_00002_20200714120523.pcap, ...

With the I<files> option it's also possible to form a "ring buffer".
This will fill up new files until the number of files specified,
at which point B<Wireshark> will discard the data in the first file and start
writing to that file and so on.  If the I<files> option is not set,
new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).

The criterion is of the form I<key>B<:>I<value>,
where I<key> is one of:

B<duration>:I<value> switch to the next file after I<value> seconds have
elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. Floating
point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

B<files>:I<value> begin again with the first file after I<value> number of
files were written (form a ring buffer).  This value must be less than 100000.
Caution should be used when using large numbers of files: some filesystems do
not handle many files in a single directory well.  The B<files> criterion
requires one of the other criteria to be specified to
control when to go to the next file.  It should be noted that each B<-b>
parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
preceded by the B<-b> option.

B<filesize>:I<value> switch to the next file after it reaches a size of
I<value> kB.  Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 GiB.

B<interval>:I<value> switch to the next file when the time is an exact
multiple of I<value> seconds.

B<packets>:I<value> switch to the next file after it contains I<value>
packets.

Example: B<-b filesize:1000 -b files:5> results in a ring buffer of five files
of size one megabyte each.

=item -B|--buffer-size  E<lt>capture buffer sizeE<gt>

Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB).  This is used by
the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk.  If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase
this size.  Note that, while B<Wireshark> attempts to set the buffer size
to 2 MiB by default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the
system or interface on which you're capturing might silently limit the
capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.

This is available on UNIX systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or later and on
Windows.  It is not available on UNIX systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the B<-i> option, it sets the default capture buffer size.
If used after an B<-i> option, it sets the capture buffer size for
the interface specified by the last B<-i> option occurring before
this option.  If the capture buffer size is not set specifically,
the default capture buffer size is used instead.

=item -c  E<lt>capture packet countE<gt>

Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live
data. Same as B<-a packets:>E<lt>capture packet countE<gt>.

=item -C  E<lt>configuration profileE<gt>

Start with the given configuration profile.

=item --capture-comment E<lt>commentE<gt>

Set the capture file comment, if supported by the capture format.

=item -d  E<lt>layer typeE<gt>==E<lt>selectorE<gt>,E<lt>decode-as protocolE<gt>

Like Wireshark's B<Decode As...> feature, this lets you specify how a
layer type should be dissected.  If the layer type in question (for example,
B<tcp.port> or B<udp.port> for a TCP or UDP port number) has the specified
selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.

Example: B<-d tcp.port==8888,http> will decode any traffic running over
TCP port 8888 as HTTP.

See the tshark(1) manual page for more examples.

=item -D|--list-interfaces

Print a list of the interfaces on which B<Wireshark> can capture, and
exit.  For each network interface, a number and an
interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the
interface, is printed.  The interface name or the number can be supplied
to the B<-i> flag to specify an interface on which to capture.

This can be useful on systems that don't have a command to list them
(UNIX systems lacking B<ifconfig -a> or Linux systems lacking
B<ip link show>). The number can be useful on Windows systems, where
the interface name might be a long name or a GUID.

Note that "can capture" means that B<Wireshark> was able to open
that device to do a live capture; if, on your system, a program doing a
network capture must be run from an account with special privileges (for
example, as root), then, if B<Wireshark> is run with the B<-D> flag and
is not run from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.

=item --display E<lt>X display to useE<gt>

Specifies the X display to use.  A hostname and screen (otherhost:0.0)
or just a screen (:0.0) can be specified.  This option is not available
under Windows.

=item --disable-protocol E<lt>proto_nameE<gt>

Disable dissection of proto_name.

=item --disable-heuristic E<lt>short_nameE<gt>

Disable dissection of heuristic protocol.

=item --enable-protocol E<lt>proto_nameE<gt>

Enable dissection of proto_name.

=item --enable-heuristic E<lt>short_nameE<gt>

Enable dissection of heuristic protocol.

=item -f  E<lt>capture filterE<gt>

Set the capture filter expression.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the B<-i> option, it sets the default capture filter expression.
If used after an B<-i> option, it sets the capture filter expression for
the interface specified by the last B<-i> option occurring before
this option.  If the capture filter expression is not set specifically,
the default capture filter expression is used if provided.

Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the GUI menu item Capture->Capture Filters,
can be used by prefixing the argument with "predef:".
Example: B<-f "predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter">

=item --fullscreen

Start Wireshark in full screen mode (kiosk mode). To exit from fullscreen mode,
open the View menu and select the Full Screen option. Alternatively, press the
F11 key (or Ctrl + Cmd + F for macOS).

=item -g  E<lt>packet numberE<gt>

After reading in a capture file using the B<-r> flag, go to the given I<packet number>.

=item -h|--help

Print the version number and options and exit.

=item -H

Hide the capture info dialog during live packet capture.

=item -i|--interface  E<lt>capture interfaceE<gt>|-

Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.

Network interface names should match one of the names listed in
"B<wireshark -D>" (described above); a number, as reported by
"B<wireshark -D>", can also be used.  If you're using UNIX, "B<netstat
-i>", "B<ifconfig -a>" or "B<ip link>" might also work to list interface names,
although not all versions of UNIX support the B<-a> flag to B<ifconfig>.

If no interface is specified, B<Wireshark> searches the list of
interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any
non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
there are no non-loopback interfaces.  If there are no interfaces at all,
B<Wireshark> reports an error and doesn't start the capture.

Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "-" to
read data from the standard input.  On Windows systems, pipe names must be
of the form "\\pipe\.\B<pipename>".  Data read from pipes must be in
standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same
endianness as the capturing host.

This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple
interfaces, the capture file will be saved in pcapng format.

=item -I|--monitor-mode

Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE
802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operating systems.

Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the
network with which it's associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could prevent accessing
files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses,
if you are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the B<-i> option, it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces.
If used after an B<-i> option, it enables the monitor mode for
the interface specified by the last B<-i> option occurring before
this option.

=item -j

Use after B<-J> to change the behavior when no exact match is found for
the filter.  With this option select the first packet before.

=item -J  E<lt>jump filterE<gt>

After reading in a capture file using the B<-r> flag, jump to the packet
matching the filter (display filter syntax).  If no exact match is found
the first packet after that is selected.

=item -k

Start the capture session immediately.  If the B<-i> flag was
specified, the capture uses the specified interface.  Otherwise,
B<Wireshark> searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first
non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and
choosing the first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback
interfaces; if there are no interfaces, B<Wireshark> reports an error and
doesn't start the capture.

=item -K  E<lt>keytabE<gt>

Load kerberos crypto keys from the specified keytab file.
This option can be used multiple times to load keys from several files.

Example: B<-K krb5.keytab>

=item -l

Turn on automatic scrolling if the packet display is being updated
automatically as packets arrive during a capture (as specified by the
B<-S> flag).

=item -L|--list-data-link-types

List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.

=item --list-time-stamp-types

List time stamp types supported for the interface. If no time stamp type can be
set, no time stamp types are listed.

=item -n

Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP port
names), the B<-N> flag might override this one.

=item -N  E<lt>name resolving flagsE<gt>

Turn on name resolving only for particular types of addresses and port
numbers, with name resolving for other types of addresses and port
numbers turned off.  This flag overrides B<-n> if both B<-N> and B<-n> are
present.  If both B<-N> and B<-n> flags are not present, all name resolutions
are turned on.

The argument is a string that may contain the letters:

B<m> to enable MAC address resolution

B<n> to enable network address resolution

B<N> to enable using external resolvers (e.g., DNS) for network address
resolution

B<t> to enable transport-layer port number resolution

B<d> to enable resolution from captured DNS packets

B<v> to enable VLAN IDs to names resolution

=item -o  E<lt>preference/recent settingE<gt>

Set a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and any value
read from a preference/recent file.  The argument to the flag is a string of
the form I<prefname>B<:>I<value>, where I<prefname> is the name of the
preference/recent value (which is the same name that would appear in the
preference/recent file), and I<value> is the value to which it should be set.
Since B<Ethereal> 0.10.12, the recent settings replaces the formerly used
-B, -P and -T flags to manipulate the GUI dimensions.

If I<prefname> is "uat", you can override settings in various user access
tables using the form uatB<:>I<uat filename>:I<uat record>.  I<uat filename>
must be the name of a UAT file, e.g. I<user_dlts>.  I<uat_record> must be in
the form of a valid record for that file, including quotes.  For instance, to
specify a user DLT from the command line, you would use

    -o "uat:user_dlts:\"User 0 (DLT=147)\",\"cops\",\"0\",\"\",\"0\",\"\""

=item -p|--no-promiscuous-mode

I<Don't> put the interface into promiscuous mode.  Note that the
interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence,
B<-p> cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
traffic sent to or from the machine on which B<Wireshark> is running,
broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic to addresses received by that
machine.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the B<-i> option, no interface will be put into the
promiscuous mode.
If used after an B<-i> option, the interface specified by the last B<-i>
option occurring before this option will not be put into the
promiscuous mode.

=item -P E<lt>path settingE<gt>

Special path settings usually detected automatically.  This is used for
special cases, e.g. starting Wireshark from a known location on an USB stick.

The criterion is of the form I<key>B<:>I<path>, where I<key> is one of:

B<persconf>:I<path> path of personal configuration files, like the
preferences files.

B<persdata>:I<path> path of personal data files, it's the folder initially
opened.  After the very first initialization, the recent file will keep the
folder last used.

=item -r|--read-file  E<lt>infileE<gt>

Read packet data from I<infile>, can be any supported capture file format
(including gzipped files).  It's not possible to use named pipes or stdin
here! To capture from a pipe or from stdin use B<-i ->

=item -R|--read-filter  E<lt>read (display) filterE<gt>

When reading a capture file specified with the B<-r> flag, causes the
specified filter (which uses the syntax of display filters, rather than
that of capture filters) to be applied to all packets read from the
capture file; packets not matching the filter are discarded.

=item -s|--snapshot-length  E<lt>capture snaplenE<gt>

Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data.
No more than I<snaplen> bytes of each network packet will be read into
memory, or saved to disk.  A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the B<-i> option, it sets the default snapshot length.
If used after an B<-i> option, it sets the snapshot length for
the interface specified by the last B<-i> option occurring before
this option.  If the snapshot length is not set specifically,
the default snapshot length is used if provided.

=item -S

Automatically update the packet display as packets are coming in.

=item -t  a|ad|adoy|d|dd|e|r|u|ud|udoy

Set the format of the packet timestamp displayed in the packet list
window.  The format can be one of:

B<a> absolute: The absolute time, as local time in your time zone,
is the actual time the packet was captured, with no date displayed

B<ad> absolute with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD,
and time, as local time in your time zone, is the actual time and date
the packet was captured

B<adoy> absolute with date using day of year: The absolute date,
displayed as YYYY/DOY, and time, as local time in your time zone,
is the actual time and date the packet was captured

B<d> delta: The delta time is the time since the previous packet was
captured

B<dd> delta_displayed: The delta_displayed time is the time since the
previous displayed packet was captured

B<e> epoch: The time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00)

B<r> relative: The relative time is the time elapsed between the first packet
and the current packet

B<u> UTC: The absolute time, as UTC, is the actual time the packet was
captured, with no date displayed

B<ud> UTC with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD,
and time, as UTC, is the actual time and date the packet was captured

B<udoy> UTC with date using day of year: The absolute date, displayed
as YYYY/DOY, and time, as UTC, is the actual time and date the packet
was captured

The default format is relative.

=item --time-stamp-type E<lt>typeE<gt>

Change the interface's timestamp method. See --list-time-stamp-types.

=item -u E<lt>s|hmsE<gt>

Output format of seconds (def: s: seconds)

=item -v|--version

Print the full version information and exit.

=item -w  E<lt>outfileE<gt>

Set the default capture file name, or '-' for standard output.

=item -X E<lt>eXtension optionsE<gt>

Specify an option to be passed to an B<Wireshark> module.  The eXtension option
is in the form I<extension_key>B<:>I<value>, where I<extension_key> can be:

B<lua_script>:I<lua_script_filename> tells B<Wireshark> to load the given script in addition to the
default Lua scripts.

B<lua_script>I<num>:I<argument> tells B<Wireshark> to pass the given argument
to the lua script identified by 'num', which is the number indexed order of the 'lua_script' command.
For example, if only one script was loaded with '-X lua_script:my.lua', then '-X lua_script1:foo'
will pass the string 'foo' to the 'my.lua' script.  If two scripts were loaded, such as '-X lua_script:my.lua'
and '-X lua_script:other.lua' in that order, then a '-X lua_script2:bar' would pass the string 'bar' to the second lua
script, namely 'other.lua'.

B<read_format>:I<file_format> tells B<Wireshark> to use the given file format to read in the
file (the file given in the B<-r> command option).

B<stdin_descr>:I<description> tells B<Wireshark> to use the given description when
capturing from standard input (B<-i ->).

=item -y|--linktype  E<lt>capture link typeE<gt>

If a capture is started from the command line with B<-k>, set the data
link type to use while capturing packets.  The values reported by B<-L>
are the values that can be used.

This option can occur multiple times.  If used before the first
occurrence of the B<-i> option, it sets the default capture link type.
If used after an B<-i> option, it sets the capture link type for
the interface specified by the last B<-i> option occurring before
this option.  If the capture link type is not set specifically,
the default capture link type is used if provided.

=item -Y|--display-filter  E<lt>displaY filterE<gt>

Start with the given display filter.

=item -z  E<lt>statisticsE<gt>

Get B<Wireshark> to collect various types of statistics and display the result
in a window that updates in semi-real time.

Currently implemented statistics are:

=over 4

=item B<-z help>

Display all possible values for B<-z>.

=item B<-z> afp,srt[,I<filter>]

Show Apple Filing Protocol service response time statistics.

=item B<-z> conv,I<type>[,I<filter>]

Create a table that lists all conversations that could be seen in the
capture.  I<type> specifies the conversation endpoint types for which we
want to generate the statistics; currently the supported ones are:

  "eth"   Ethernet addresses
  "fc"    Fibre Channel addresses
  "fddi"  FDDI addresses
  "ip"    IPv4 addresses
  "ipv6"  IPv6 addresses
  "ipx"   IPX addresses
  "tcp"   TCP/IP socket pairs   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
  "tr"    Token Ring addresses
  "udp"   UDP/IP socket pairs   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

If the optional I<filter> is specified, only those packets that match the
filter will be used in the calculations.

The table is presented with one line for each conversation and displays
the number of packets/bytes in each direction as well as the total
number of packets/bytes.  By default, the table is sorted according to
the total number of packets.

These tables can also be generated at runtime by selecting the appropriate
conversation type from the menu "Tools/Statistics/Conversation List/".

=item B<-z> dcerpc,srt,I<name-or-uuid>,I<major>.I<minor>[,I<filter>]

Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for DCERPC interface
I<name> or I<uuid>, version I<major>.I<minor>.
Data collected is the number of calls for each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT
and AvgSRT.
Interface I<name> and I<uuid> are case-insensitive.

Example: S<B<-z dcerpc,srt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0>> will collect data for the CIFS SAMR Interface.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional I<filter>  is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.

Example: S<B<-z dcerpc,srt,12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac,1.0,ip.addr==1.2.3.4>> will collect SAMR
SRT statistics for a specific host.

=item B<-z> bootp,stat[,I<filter>]

Show DHCP (BOOTP) statistics.

=item B<-z> expert

Show expert information.

=item B<-z> fc,srt[,I<filter>]

Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for FC.  Data collected
is the number of calls for each Fibre Channel command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.

Example: B<-z fc,srt>
will calculate the Service Response Time as the time delta between the
First packet of the exchange and the Last packet of the exchange.

The data will be presented as separate tables for all normal FC commands,
Only those commands that are seen in the capture will have its stats
displayed.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional I<filter> is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.

Example: B<-z "fc,srt,fc.id==01.02.03"> will collect stats only for
FC packets exchanged by the host at FC address 01.02.03 .

=item B<-z> h225,counter[I<,filter>]

Count ITU-T H.225 messages and their reasons.  In the first column you get a
list of H.225 messages and H.225 message reasons which occur in the current
capture file.  The number of occurrences of each message or reason is displayed
in the second column.

Example: B<-z h225,counter>

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional I<filter> is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.

for each known MGCP Type, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT and Average SRT.

Example: B<-z mgcp,srt>

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional I<filter> is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.

Example: B<-z "mgcp,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4"> will collect stats only for
MGCP packets exchanged by the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .

Example: B<-z rpc,srt,100003,3> will collect data for NFS v3.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional I<filter> is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.

Example: S<B<-z rpc,srt,nfs,3,nfs.fh.hash==0x12345678>> will collect NFS v3
SRT statistics for a specific file.

=item B<-z> scsi,srt,I<cmdset>[,<filter>]

Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SCSI commandset <cmdset>.

Commandsets are 0:SBC   1:SSC  5:MMC

Data collected
is the number of calls for each procedure, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.

SIP packets exchanged by the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .

=item B<-z> smb,srt[,I<filter>]

Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SMB.  Data collected
is the number of calls for each SMB command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.

Example: B<-z smb,srt>

The data will be presented as separate tables for all normal SMB commands,
all Transaction2 commands and all NT Transaction commands.
Only those commands that are seen in the capture will have their stats
displayed.
Only the first command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the
calculation.  So for common SessionSetupAndX + TreeConnectAndX chains,
only the SessionSetupAndX call will be used in the statistics.
This is a flaw that might be fixed in the future.

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

If the optional I<filter> is provided, the stats will only be calculated
on those calls that match that filter.

Example: B<-z "smb,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4"> will collect stats only for
SMB packets exchanged by the host at IP address 1.2.3.4 .

=item B<-z> voip,calls

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 MENU ITEMS

=over 4

=item File:Open

=item File:Open Recent

=item File:Merge

Merge another capture file to the currently loaded one.  The I<File:Merge>
dialog box allows the merge "Prepended", "Chronologically" or "Appended",
relative to the already loaded one.

=item File:Close

Open or close a capture file.  The I<File:Open> dialog box
allows a filter to be specified; when the capture file is read, the
filter is applied to all packets read from the file, and packets not
matching the filter are discarded.  The I<File:Open Recent> is a submenu
and will show a list of previously opened files.

=item File:Save

=item File:Save As

Save the current capture, or the packets currently displayed from that
capture, to a file.  Check boxes let you select whether to save all
packets, or just those that have passed the current display filter and/or
those that are currently marked, and an option menu lets you select (from
a list of file formats in which at particular capture, or the packets
currently displayed from that capture, can be saved), a file format in
which to save it.

=item File:File Set:List Files

Show a dialog box that lists all files of the file set matching the currently
loaded file.  A file set is a compound of files resulting from a capture using
the "multiple files" / "ringbuffer" mode, recognizable by the filename pattern,
e.g.: Filename_00001_20200714101530.pcap.

=item File:File Set:Next File

=item File:File Set:Previous File

If the currently loaded file is part of a file set (see above), open the
next / previous file in that set.

=item File:Export

Export captured data into an external format.  Note: the data cannot be
imported back into Wireshark, so be sure to keep the capture file.

=item File:Print

Print packet data from the current capture.  You can select the range of
packets to be printed (which packets are printed), and the output format of
each packet (how each packet is printed).  The output format will be similar
to the displayed values, so a summary line, the packet details view, and/or
the hex dump of the packet can be printed.

Printing options can be set with the I<Edit:Preferences> menu item, or in the
dialog box popped up by this menu item.

=item File:Quit

Exit the application.

=item Edit:Copy:Description

Copies the description of the selected field in the protocol tree to
the clipboard.

=item Edit:Copy:Fieldname

Copies the fieldname of the selected field in the protocol tree to
the clipboard.

=item Edit:Copy:Value

Copies the value of the selected field in the protocol tree to
the clipboard.

=item Edit:Copy:As Filter

Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details and copy that filter to the clipboard.

If that data is a field that can be tested in a display filter
expression, the display filter will test that field; otherwise, the
display filter will be based on the absolute offset within the packet.
Therefore it could be unreliable if the packet contains protocols with
variable-length headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.

=item Edit:Find Packet

Search forward or backward, starting with the currently selected packet
(or the most recently selected packet, if no packet is selected).  Search
criteria can be a display filter expression, a string of hexadecimal
digits, or a text string.

When searching for a text string, you can search the packet data, or you
can search the text in the Info column in the packet list pane or in the
packet details pane.

Hexadecimal digits can be separated by colons, periods, or dashes.
Text string searches can be ASCII or Unicode (or both), and may be
case insensitive.

=item Edit:Find Next

=item Edit:Find Previous

Search forward / backward for a packet matching the filter from the previous
search, starting with the currently selected packet (or the most recently
selected packet, if no packet is selected).

=item Edit:Mark Packet (toggle)

Mark (or unmark if currently marked) the selected packet.  The field
"frame.marked" is set for packets that are marked, so that, for example,
a display filters can be used to display only marked packets, and so that
the L</"Edit:Find Packet"> dialog can be used to find the next or previous
marked packet.

=item Edit:Find Next Mark

=item Edit:Find Previous Mark

Find next/previous marked packet.

=item Edit:Mark All Packets

=item Edit:Unmark All Packets

Mark / Unmark all packets that are currently displayed.

=item Edit:Time Reference:Set Time Reference (toggle)

Set (or unset if currently set) the selected packet as a Time Reference packet.
When a packet is set as a Time Reference packet, the timestamps in the packet
list pane will be replaced with the string "*REF*".
The relative time timestamp in later packets will then be calculated relative
to the timestamp of this Time Reference packet and not the first packet in
the capture.

Packets that have been selected as Time Reference packets will always be
displayed in the packet list pane.  Display filters will not affect or
hide these packets.

If there is a column displayed for "Cumulative Bytes" this counter will
be reset at every Time Reference packet.

=item Edit:Time Reference:Find Next

=item Edit:Time Reference:Find Previous

Search forward / backward for a time referenced packet.

=item Edit:Configuration Profiles

Manage configuration profiles to be able to use more than one set of
preferences and configurations.

=item Edit:Preferences

Set the GUI, capture, printing and protocol options
(see L</Preferences> dialog below).

=item View:Main Toolbar

=item View:Filter Toolbar

=item View:Statusbar

Show or hide the main window controls.

=item View:Packet List

=item View:Packet Details

=item View:Packet Bytes

Show or hide the main window panes.

=item View:Time Display Format

Set the format of the packet timestamp displayed in the packet list window.

=item View:Name Resolution:Resolve Name

Try to resolve a name for the currently selected item.

=item View:Name Resolution:Enable for ... Layer

Enable or disable translation of addresses to names in the display.

=item View:Colorize Packet List

Enable or disable the coloring rules.  Disabling will improve performance.

=item View:Auto Scroll in Live Capture

Enable or disable the automatic scrolling of the
packet list while a live capture is in progress.

=item View:Zoom In

=item View:Zoom Out

Zoom into / out of the main window data (by changing the font size).

=item View:Normal Size

Reset the zoom factor of zoom in / zoom out back to normal font size.

=item View:Resize All Columns

Resize all columns to best fit the current packet display.

=item View:Expand / Collapse Subtrees

Expands / Collapses the currently selected item and it's subtrees in the packet details.

=item View:Expand All

=item View:Collapse All

Expand / Collapse all branches of the packet details.

=item View:Colorize Conversation

Select color for a conversation.

=item View:Reset Coloring 1-10

Reset Color for a conversation.

=item View:Coloring Rules

Change the foreground and background colors of the packet information in
the list of packets, based upon display filters.  The list of display
filters is applied to each packet sequentially.  After the first display
filter matches a packet, any additional display filters in the list are
ignored.  Therefore, if you are filtering on the existence of protocols,
you should list the higher-level protocols first, and the lower-level
protocols last.

=over

=item How Colorization Works

Packets are colored according to a list of color filters.  Each filter
consists of a name, a filter expression and a coloration.  A packet is
colored according to the first filter that it matches.  Color filter
expressions use exactly the same syntax as display filter expressions.

When Wireshark starts, the color filters are loaded from:

=over

=item 1.

The user's personal color filters file or, if that does not exist,

=item 2.

The global color filters file.

=back

If neither of these exist then the packets will not be colored.

=back

=item View:Show Packet In New Window

Create a new window containing a packet details view and a hex dump
window of the currently selected packet; this window will continue to
display that packet's details and data even if another packet is
selected.

=item View:Reload

Reload a capture file.  Same as I<File:Close> and I<File:Open> the same
file again.

=item Go:Back

Go back in previously visited packets history.

=item Go:Forward

Go forward in previously visited packets history.

=item Go:Go To Packet

Go to a particular numbered packet.

=item Go:Go To Corresponding Packet

If a field in the packet details pane containing a packet number is
selected, go to the packet number specified by that field.  (This works
only if the dissector that put that entry into the packet details put it
into the details as a filterable field rather than just as text.) This
can be used, for example, to go to the packet for the request
corresponding to a reply, or the reply corresponding to a request, if
that packet number has been put into the packet details.

=item Go:Previous Packet

=item Go:Next Packet

=item Go:First Packet

=item Go:Last Packet

Go to the previous / next / first / last packet in the capture.

=item Go:Previous Packet In Conversation

=item Go:Next Packet In Conversation

Go to the previous / next packet of the conversation (TCP, UDP or IP)

=item Capture:Interfaces

Shows a dialog box with all currently known interfaces and displaying the
current network traffic amount.  Capture sessions can be started from here.
Beware: keeping this box open results in high system load!

=item Capture:Options

Initiate a live packet capture (see L</"Capture Options Dialog">
below).  If no filename is specified, a temporary file will be created
to hold the capture.  The location of the file can be chosen by setting your
TMPDIR environment variable before starting B<Wireshark>.  Otherwise, the
default TMPDIR location is system-dependent, but is likely either F</var/tmp>
or F</tmp>.

=item Capture:Start

Start a live packet capture with the previously selected options.  This won't
open the options dialog box, and can be convenient for repeatedly capturing
with the same options.

=item Capture:Stop

Stop a running live capture.

=item Capture:Restart

While a live capture is running, stop it and restart with the same options
again.  This can be convenient to remove irrelevant packets, if no valuable
packets were captured so far.

=item Capture:Capture Filters

Edit the saved list of capture filters, allowing filters to be added,
changed, or deleted.

=item Analyze:Display Filters

Edit the saved list of display filters, allowing filters to be added,
changed, or deleted.

=item Analyze:Display Filter Macros

Create shortcuts for complex macros

=item Analyze:Apply as Filter

Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details and apply the filter.

If that data is a field that can be tested in a display filter
expression, the display filter will test that field; otherwise, the
display filter will be based on the absolute offset within the packet.
Therefore it could be unreliable if the packet contains protocols with
variable-length headers, such as a source-routed token-ring packet.

The B<Selected> option creates a display filter that tests for a match
of the data; the B<Not Selected> option creates a display filter that
tests for a non-match of the data.  The B<And Selected>, B<Or Selected>,
B<And Not Selected>, and B<Or Not Selected> options add to the end of
the display filter in the strip at the top (or bottom) an AND or OR
operator followed by the new display filter expression.

=item Analyze:Prepare as Filter

Create a display filter based on the data currently highlighted in the
packet details.  The filter strip at the top (or bottom) is updated but
it is not yet applied.

=item Analyze:Enabled Protocols

Allow protocol dissection to be enabled or disabled for a specific
protocol.  Individual protocols can be enabled or disabled by clicking
on them in the list or by highlighting them and pressing the space bar.
The entire list can be enabled, disabled, or inverted using the buttons
below the list.

When a protocol is disabled, dissection in a particular packet stops
when that protocol is reached, and Wireshark moves on to the next packet.
Any higher-layer protocols that would otherwise have been processed will
not be displayed.  For example, disabling TCP will prevent the dissection
and display of TCP, HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and any other protocol exclusively
dependent on TCP.

The list of protocols can be saved, so that Wireshark will start up with
the protocols in that list disabled.

=item Analyze:Decode As

If you have a packet selected, present a dialog allowing you to change
which dissectors are used to decode this packet.  The dialog has one
panel each for the link layer, network layer and transport layer
protocol/port numbers, and will allow each of these to be changed
independently.  For example, if the selected packet is a TCP packet to
port 12345, using this dialog you can instruct Wireshark to decode all
packets to or from that TCP port as HTTP packets.

=item Analyze:User Specified Decodes

Create a new window showing whether any protocol ID to dissector
mappings have been changed by the user.  This window also allows the
user to reset all decodes to their default values.

=item Analyze:Follow TCP Stream

If you have a TCP packet selected, display the contents of the data
stream for the TCP connection to which that packet belongs, as text, in
a separate window, and leave the list of packets in a filtered state,
with only those packets that are part of that TCP connection being
displayed.  You can revert to your old view by pressing ENTER in the
display filter text box, thereby invoking your old display filter (or
resetting it back to no display filter).

The window in which the data stream is displayed lets you select:

=over 8

=item *

whether to display the entire conversation, or one or the other side of
it;

=item *

whether the data being displayed is to be treated as ASCII or EBCDIC
text or as raw hex data;

=back

and lets you print what's currently being displayed, using the same
print options that are used for the I<File:Print Packet> menu item, or
save it as text to a file.

=item Analyze:Follow UDP Stream

=item Analyze:Follow TLS Stream

(Similar to Analyze:Follow TCP Stream)

=item Analyze:Expert Info

=item Analyze:Expert Info Composite

(Kind of) a log of anomalies found by Wireshark in a capture file.

=item Analyze:Conversation Filter

=item Statistics:Summary

Show summary information about the capture, including elapsed time,
packet counts, byte counts, and the like.  If a display filter is in
effect, summary information will be shown about the capture and about
the packets currently being displayed.

=item Statistics:Protocol Hierarchy

Show the number of packets, and the number of bytes in those packets,
for each protocol in the trace.  It organizes the protocols in the same
hierarchy in which they were found in the trace.  Besides counting the
packets in which the protocol exists, a count is also made for packets
in which the protocol is the last protocol in the stack.  These
last-protocol counts show you how many packets (and the byte count
associated with those packets) B<ended> in a particular protocol.  In
the table, they are listed under "End Packets" and "End Bytes".

=item Statistics:Conversations

Lists of conversations; selectable by protocol.  See Statistics:Conversation List below.

=item Statistics:End Points

List of End Point Addresses by protocol with packets/bytes/.... counts.

=item Statistics:Packet Lengths

Grouped counts of packet lengths (0-19 bytes, 20-39 bytes, ...)

=item Statistics:I/O Graphs

Open a window where up to 5 graphs in different colors can be displayed
to indicate number of packets or number of bytes per second for all packets
matching the specified filter.
By default only one graph will be displayed showing number of packets per second.

The top part of the window contains the graphs and scales for the X and
Y axis.  If the graph is too long to fit inside the window there is a
horizontal scrollbar below the drawing area that can scroll the graphs
to the left or the right.  The horizontal axis displays the time into
the capture and the vertical axis will display the measured quantity at
that time.

Below the drawing area and the scrollbar are the controls.  On the
bottom left there will be five similar sets of controls to control each
individual graph such as "Display:<button>" which button will toggle
that individual graph on/off.  If <button> is ticked, the graph will be
displayed. "Color:<color>" which is just a button to show which color
will be used to draw that graph. Finally "Filter:<filter-text>" which
can be used to specify a display filter for that particular graph.

If filter-text is empty then all packets will be used to calculate the
quantity for that graph.  If filter-text is specified only those packets
that match that display filter will be considered in the calculation of
quantity.

To the right of the 5 graph controls there are four menus to control
global aspects of the draw area and graphs.  The "Unit:" menu is used to
control what to measure; "packets/tick", "bytes/tick" or "advanced..."

packets/tick will measure the number of packets matching the (if
specified) display filter for the graph in each measurement interval.

bytes/tick will measure the total number of bytes in all packets matching
the (if specified) display filter for the graph in each measurement
interval.

advanced... see below

"Tick interval:" specifies what measurement intervals to use.  The
default is 1 second and means that the data will be counted over 1
second intervals.

"Pixels per tick:" specifies how many pixels wide each measurement
interval will be in the drawing area.  The default is 5 pixels per tick.

"Y-scale:" controls the max value for the y-axis.  Default value is
"auto" which means that B<Wireshark> will try to adjust the maxvalue
automatically.

"advanced..." If Unit:advanced...  is selected the window will display
two more controls for each of the five graphs.  One control will be a
menu where the type of calculation can be selected from
SUM,COUNT,MAX,MIN,AVG and LOAD, and one control, textbox, where the name of a
single display filter field can be specified.

The following restrictions apply to type and field combinations:

SUM: available for all types of integers and will calculate the SUM of
all occurrences of this field in the measurement interval.  Note that
some field can occur multiple times in the same packet and then all
instances will be summed up.  Example: 'tcp.len' which will count the
amount of payload data transferred across TCP in each interval.

COUNT: available for all field types.  This will COUNT the number of times
certain field occurs in each interval.  Note that some fields
may occur multiple times in each packet and if that is the case
then each instance will be counted independently and COUNT
will be greater than the number of packets.

MAX: available for all integer and relative time fields.  This will calculate
the max seen integer/time value seen for the field during the interval.
Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the maximum SMB response time.

MIN: available for all integer and relative time fields.  This will calculate
the min seen integer/time value seen for the field during the interval.
Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the minimum SMB response time.

AVG: available for all integer and relative time fields.This will
calculate the average seen integer/time value seen for the field during
the interval.  Example: 'smb.time' which will plot the average SMB
response time.

LOAD: available only for relative time fields (response times).

Example of advanced:
Display how NFS response time MAX/MIN/AVG changes over time:

Set first graph to:

   filter:nfs&&rpc.time
   Calc:MAX rpc.time

Set second graph to

   filter:nfs&&rpc.time
   Calc:AVG rpc.time

Set third graph to

   filter:nfs&&rpc.time
   Calc:MIN rpc.time

Example of advanced:
Display how the average packet size from host a.b.c.d changes over time.

Set first graph to

   filter:ip.addr==a.b.c.d&&frame.pkt_len
   Calc:AVG frame.pkt_len

LOAD:
The LOAD io-stat type is very different from anything you have ever seen
before! While the response times themselves as plotted by MIN,MAX,AVG are
indications on the Server load (which affects the Server response time),
the LOAD measurement measures the Client LOAD.
What this measures is how much workload the client generates,
i.e. how fast will the client issue new commands when the previous ones
completed.
i.e. the level of concurrency the client can maintain.
The higher the number, the more and faster is the client issuing new
commands.  When the LOAD goes down, it may be due to client load making
the client slower in issuing new commands (there may be other reasons as
well, maybe the client just doesn't have any commands it wants to issue
right then).

Load is measured in concurrency/number of overlapping i/o and the value
1000 means there is a constant load of one i/o.

In each tick interval the amount of overlap is measured.
See the graph below containing three commands:
Below the graph are the LOAD values for each interval that would be calculated.

=item Statistics:Conversation List

This option will open a new window that displays a list of all
conversations between two endpoints.  The list has one row for each
unique conversation and displays total number of packets/bytes seen as
well as number of packets/bytes in each direction.

By default the list is sorted according to the number of packets but by

ascending or descending order by any column.

By first selecting a conversation by clicking on it and then using the
right mouse button (on those platforms that have a right

DCE-RPC

Open a window to display Service Response Time statistics for an
arbitrary DCE-RPC program
interface and display B<Procedure>, B<Number of Calls>, B<Minimum SRT>,
B<Maximum SRT> and B<Average SRT> for all procedures for that
program/version.  These windows opened will update in semi-real time to
reflect changes when doing live captures or when reading new capture
files into B<Wireshark>.

This dialog will also allow an optional filter string to be used.
If an optional filter string is used only such DCE-RPC request/response pairs
that match that filter will be used to calculate the statistics.  If no filter
string is specified all request/response pairs will be used.

Data collected is B<number of calls> for each known ITU-T H.225 RAS Message Type,
B<Minimum SRT>, B<Maximum SRT>, B<Average SRT>, B<Minimum in Packet>, and B<Maximum in Packet>.
You will also get the number of B<Open Requests> (Unresponded Requests),
B<Discarded Responses> (Responses without matching request) and Duplicate Messages.
These windows opened will update in semi-real time to reflect changes when

SMB

Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SMB.  Data collected
is the number of calls for each SMB command, MinSRT, MaxSRT and AvgSRT.

The data will be presented as separate tables for all normal SMB commands,
all Transaction2 commands and all NT Transaction commands.
Only those commands that are seen in the capture will have its stats
displayed.
Only the first command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the
calculation.  So for common SessionSetupAndX + TreeConnectAndX chains,
only the SessionSetupAndX call will be used in the statistics.
This is a flaw that might be fixed in the future.

=head2 WINDOWS

=over 4

=item Main Window

The main window contains the usual things like the menu, some toolbars, the
main area and a statusbar.  The main area is split into three panes, you can
resize each pane using a "thumb" at the right end of each divider line.

The main window is much more flexible than before.  The layout of the main
window can be customized by the I<Layout> page in the dialog box popped
up by I<Edit:Preferences>, the following will describe the layout with the
default settings.

=over 6

=item Main Toolbar

Some menu items are available for quick access here.  There is no way to
customize the items in the toolbar, however the toolbar can be hidden by
I<View:Main Toolbar>.

=item Filter Toolbar

A display filter can be entered into the filter toolbar.
A filter for HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS traffic might look like this:

  tcp.port in {80 443 53}

Selecting the I<Filter:> button lets you choose from a list of named
filters that you can optionally save.  Pressing the Return or Enter
keys, or selecting the I<Apply> button, will cause the filter to be
applied to the current list of packets.  Selecting the I<Reset> button
clears the display filter so that all packets are displayed (again).

There is no way to customize the items in the toolbar, however the toolbar
can be hidden by I<View:Filter Toolbar>.

=item Packet List Pane

The top pane contains the list of network packets that you can scroll
through and select.  By default, the packet number, packet timestamp,
source and destination addresses, protocol, and description are
displayed for each packet; the I<Columns> page in the dialog box popped
up by I<Edit:Preferences> lets you change this (although, unfortunately,
you currently have to save the preferences, and exit and restart
Wireshark, for those changes to take effect).

If you click on the heading for a column, the display will be sorted by
that column; clicking on the heading again will reverse the sort order
for that column.

An effort is made to display information as high up the protocol stack
as possible, e.g. IP addresses are displayed for IP packets, but the
MAC layer address is displayed for unknown packet types.

The right mouse button can be used to pop up a menu of operations.

The middle mouse button can be used to mark a packet.

=item Packet Details Pane

The middle pane contains a display of the details of the
currently-selected packet.  The display shows each field and its value
in each protocol header in the stack.  The right mouse button can be
used to pop up a menu of operations.

=item Packet Bytes Pane

The lowest pane contains a hex and ASCII dump of the actual packet data.
Selecting a field in the packet details highlights the corresponding
bytes in this section.

The right mouse button can be used to pop up a menu of operations.

=item Statusbar

The statusbar is divided into three parts, on the left some context dependent
things are shown, like information about the loaded file, in the center the
number of packets are displayed, and on the right the current configuration
profile.

The statusbar can be hidden by I<View:Statusbar>.

The selection bar in the packet list and packet details can have either
a "browse" or "select" behavior.  If the selection bar has a "browse"
behavior, the arrow keys will move an outline of the selection bar,
allowing you to browse the rest of the list or details without changing
the selection until you press the space bar.  If the selection bar has a
"select" behavior, the arrow keys will move the selection bar and change
the selection to the new item in the packet list or packet details.

=item Save Window Position

If this item is selected, the position of the main Wireshark window will
be saved when Wireshark exits, and used when Wireshark is started again.

=item Save Window Size

If this item is selected, the size of the main Wireshark window will
be saved when Wireshark exits, and used when Wireshark is started again.

=item Save Window Maximized state

If this item is selected the maximize state of the main Wireshark window
will be saved when Wireshark exists, and used when Wireshark is started again.

=item File Open Dialog Behavior

This item allows the user to select how Wireshark handles the listing
of the "File Open" Dialog when opening trace files.  "Remember Last
Directory" causes Wireshark to automatically position the dialog in the
directory of the most recently opened file, even between launches of Wireshark.
"Always Open in Directory" allows the user to define a persistent directory
that the dialog will always default to.

=item Directory

Allows the user to specify a persistent File Open directory.  Trailing
slashes or backslashes will automatically be added.

=item File Open Preview timeout

This items allows the user to define how much time is spend reading the
capture file to present preview data in the File Open dialog.

=item Open Recent maximum list entries

The File menu supports a recent file list.  This items allows the user to
specify how many files are kept track of in this list.

=item Ask for unsaved capture files

When closing a capture file or Wireshark itself if the file isn't saved yet
the user is presented the option to save the file when this item is set.

=item Wrap during find

This items determines the behavior when reaching the beginning or the end
of a capture file.  When set the search wraps around and continues, otherwise
it stops.

=item Settings dialogs show a save button

This item determines if the various dialogs sport an explicit Save button
or that save is implicit in OK / Apply.

=item Color Preferences

The I<Colors> page can be used to change the color of the text
displayed in the TCP stream window and for marked packets.  To change a color,
simply select an attribute from the "Set:" menu and use the color selector to
get the desired color.  The new text colors are displayed as a sample text.

=item Capture Preferences

The I<Capture> page lets you specify various parameters for capturing
live packet data; these are used the first time a capture is started.

The I<Interface:> combo box lets you specify the interface from which to
capture packet data, or the name of a FIFO from which to get the packet
data.

The I<Data link type:> option menu lets you, for some interfaces, select
the data link header you want to see on the packets you capture.  For
example, in some OSes and with some versions of libpcap, you can choose,
on an 802.11 interface, whether the packets should appear as Ethernet
packets (with a fake Ethernet header) or as 802.11 packets.

The I<Limit each packet to ... bytes> check box lets you set the
snapshot length to use when capturing live data; turn on the check box,
and then set the number of bytes to use as the snapshot length.

The I<Filter:> text entry lets you set a capture filter expression to be
used when capturing.

If any of the environment variables SSH_CONNECTION, SSH_CLIENT,
REMOTEHOST, DISPLAY, or SESSIONNAME are set, Wireshark will create a
default capture filter that excludes traffic from the hosts and ports
defined in those variables.

The I<Capture packets in promiscuous mode> check box lets you specify
whether to put the interface in promiscuous mode when capturing.

The I<Update list of packets in real time> check box lets you specify
that the display should be updated as packets are seen.

The I<Automatic scrolling in live capture> check box lets you specify
whether, in an "Update list of packets in real time" capture, the packet
list pane should automatically scroll to show the most recently captured
packets.

=item Printing Preferences

The radio buttons at the top of the I<Printing> page allow you choose
between printing packets with the I<File:Print Packet> menu item as text
or PostScript, and sending the output directly to a command or saving it
to a file.  The I<Command:> text entry box, on UNIX-compatible systems,
is the command to send files to (usually B<lpr>), and the I<File:> entry
box lets you enter the name of the file you wish to save to.
Additionally, you can select the I<File:> button to browse the file
system for a particular save file.

=item Name Resolution Preferences

The I<Enable MAC name resolution>, I<Enable network name resolution> and
I<Enable transport name resolution> check boxes let you specify whether
MAC addresses, network addresses, and transport-layer port numbers
should be translated to names.

The I<Enable concurrent DNS name resolution> allows Wireshark to send out
multiple name resolution requests and not wait for the result before
continuing dissection.  This speeds up dissection with network name
resolution but initially may miss resolutions.  The number of concurrent
requests can be set here as well.

I<SMI paths>

I<SMI modules>

=item RTP Player Preferences

This page allows you to select the number of channels visible in the
RTP player window.  It determines the height of the window, more channels

=item Add Expression...

For display filter expressions, pops up a dialog box to allow you to
construct a filter expression to test a particular field; it offers
lists of field names, and, when appropriate, lists from which to select
tests to perform on the field and values with which to compare it.  In
that dialog box, the OK button will cause the filter expression you
constructed to be entered into the I<Filter string> entry at the current
cursor position.

=item OK

In the I<Capture Filter> dialog, closes the dialog box and makes the
filter in the I<Filter string> entry the filter in the I<Capture

least before the filter will be accepted.  The format of color filter
expressions is identical to that of display filters.  The new filter is
selected, so it may immediately be moved up and down, deleted or edited.
To avoid confusion all filters are unselected before the new filter is
created.

=item EDIT

Opens the Edit Color Filter dialog box for the selected filter. (If this
button is disabled you may have more than one filter selected, making it
ambiguous which is to be edited.)

=item ENABLE

(you must have sufficient permissions to write this file, of course).

=item IMPORT

Allows you to choose a file containing color filters which are then
added to the bottom of the current list.  All the added filters are
selected, so they may be moved to the correct position in the list as a
group.  To avoid confusion, all filters are unselected before the new
filters are imported.  A button is provided to load the filters from the
global color filters file.

=item CLEAR

=item SAVE

Saves the current list of color filters in your personal color filters
file.  Unless you do this they will not be used the next time you start
Wireshark.

=item CLOSE

Closes the dialog without changing the coloration of the packets.  Note
that changes you have made to the current list of color filters are not
undone.

=back

=item Capture Options Dialog

The I<Capture Options Dialog> lets you specify various parameters for
capturing live packet data.

The I<Interface:> field lets you specify the interface from which to
capture packet data or a command from which to get the packet data via a
pipe.

The I<Link layer header type:> field lets you specify the interfaces link
layer header type.  This field is usually disabled, as most interface have
only one header type.

The I<Capture packets in promiscuous mode> check box lets you specify
whether the interface should be put into promiscuous mode when
capturing.

The I<Limit each packet to ... bytes> check box and field lets you
specify a maximum number of bytes per packet to capture and save; if the
check box is not checked, the limit will be 262144 bytes.

The I<Capture Filter:> entry lets you specify the capture filter using a
tcpdump-style filter string as described above.

The I<File:> entry lets you specify the file into which captured packets
should be saved, as in the I<Printer Options> dialog above.  If not
specified, the captured packets will be saved in a temporary file; you
can save those packets to a file with the I<File:Save As> menu item.

The I<Use multiple files> check box lets you specify that the capture
should be done in "multiple files" mode.  This option is disabled, if the
I<Update list of packets in real time> option is checked.

The I<Next file every ...  megabyte(s)> check box and fields lets
you specify that a switch to a next file should be done
if the specified filesize is reached.  You can also select the appropriate
unit, but beware that the filesize has a maximum of 2 GiB.
The check box is forced to be checked, as "multiple files" mode requires a
file size to be specified.

The I<Next file every ... minute(s)> check box and fields lets
you specify that the switch to a next file should be done after the specified
time has elapsed, even if the specified capture size is not reached.

The I<Ring buffer with ... files> field lets you specify the number
of files of a ring buffer.  This feature will capture into the first file
again, after the specified number of files have been used.

The I<Stop capture after ... files> field lets you specify the number
of capture files used, until the capture is stopped.

The I<Stop capture after ... packet(s)> check box and field let
you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after having captured
some number of packets; if the check box is not checked, Wireshark will
not stop capturing at some fixed number of captured packets.

The I<Stop capture after ... megabyte(s)> check box and field lets
you specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after the file to which
captured packets are being saved grows as large as or larger than some
specified number of megabytes.  If the check box is not checked, Wireshark
will not stop capturing at some capture file size (although the operating
system on which Wireshark is running, or the available disk space, may still
limit the maximum size of a capture file).  This option is disabled, if
"multiple files" mode is used,

The I<Stop capture after ...  second(s)> check box and field let you
specify that Wireshark should stop capturing after it has been capturing
for some number of seconds; if the check box is not checked, Wireshark
will not stop capturing after some fixed time has elapsed.

The I<Update list of packets in real time> check box lets you specify
whether the display should be updated as packets are captured and, if
you specify that, the I<Automatic scrolling in live capture> check box
lets you specify the packet list pane should automatically scroll to
show the most recently captured packets as new packets arrive.

The I<Enable MAC name resolution>, I<Enable network name resolution> and
I<Enable transport name resolution> check boxes let you specify whether
MAC addresses, network addresses, and transport-layer port numbers
should be translated to names.

=item About

The I<About> dialog lets you view various information about Wireshark.

=item About:Wireshark

The I<Wireshark> page lets you view general information about Wireshark,
like the installed version, licensing information and such.

=item About:Authors

The I<Authors> page shows the author and all contributors.

=item About:Folders

The I<Folders> page lets you view the directory names where Wireshark is
searching it's various configuration and other files.

=item About:Plugins

The I<Plugins> page lets you view the dissector plugin modules
available on your system.

The I<Plugins List> shows the name and version of each dissector plugin
module found on your system.

On Unix-compatible systems, the plugins are looked for in the following
directories: the F<lib/wireshark/plugins/$VERSION> directory under the
main installation directory (for example,
F</usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/$VERSION>), and then
F<$HOME/.wireshark/plugins>.

On Windows systems, the plugins are looked for in the following
directories: F<plugins\$VERSION> directory under the main installation
directory (for example, F<C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\$VERSION>),
and then F<%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins\$VERSION> (or, if %APPDATA% isn't
defined, F<%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Wireshark\plugins\$VERSION>).

$VERSION is the version number of the plugin interface, which
is typically the version number of Wireshark.  Note that a dissector
plugin module may support more than one protocol; there is not
necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between dissector plugin modules
and protocols.  Protocols supported by a dissector plugin module are
enabled and disabled using the I<Edit:Protocols> dialog box, just as
protocols built into Wireshark are.

read first, overriding the default settings.  If the personal preferences
file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous values.  Note: If
the command line flag B<-o> is used (possibly more than once), it will
in turn override values from the preferences files.

The preferences settings are in the form I<prefname>B<:>I<value>,
one per line,
where I<prefname> is the name of the preference
and I<value> is the value to
which it should be set; white space is allowed between B<:> and
I<value>.  A preference setting can be continued on subsequent lines by
indenting the continuation lines with white space.  A B<#> character
starts a comment that runs to the end of the line:

  # Vertical scrollbars should be on right side?
  # TRUE or FALSE (case-insensitive).
  gui.scrollbar_on_right: TRUE

The global preferences file is looked for in the F<wireshark> directory
under the F<share> subdirectory of the main installation directory (for
example, F</usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences>) on UNIX-compatible
systems, and in the main installation directory (for example,
F<C:\Program Files\Wireshark\preferences>) on Windows systems.

The personal preferences file is looked for in
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/preferences>
(or, if F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark> does not exist while F<$HOME/.wireshark>
is present, F<$HOME/.wireshark/preferences>) on
UNIX-compatible systems and F<%APPDATA%\Wireshark\preferences> (or, if
%APPDATA% isn't defined, F<%USERPROFILE%\Application
Data\Wireshark\preferences>) on Windows systems.

Note: Whenever the preferences are saved by using the I<Save> button
in the I<Edit:Preferences> dialog box, your personal preferences file
will be overwritten with the new settings, destroying any comments and
unknown/obsolete settings that were in the file.

=item Recent

The F<recent> file contains personal settings (mostly GUI related) such
as the current B<Wireshark> window size.  The file is saved at program exit and
read in at program start automatically.  Note: The command line flag B<-o>
may be used to override settings from this file.

The settings in this file have the same format as in the F<preferences>
files, and the same directory as for the personal preferences file is
used.

Note: Whenever Wireshark is closed, your recent file
will be overwritten with the new settings, destroying any comments and
unknown/obsolete settings that were in the file.

=item Disabled (Enabled) Protocols

The F<disabled_protos> files contain system-wide and personal lists of
protocols that have been disabled, so that their dissectors are never
called.  The files contain protocol names, one per line, where the
protocol name is the same name that would be used in a display filter
for the protocol:

  http
  tcp     # a comment

If a protocol is listed in the global F<disabled_protos> file, it is not
displayed in the I<Analyze:Enabled Protocols> dialog box, and so cannot
be enabled by the user.

The global F<disabled_protos> file uses the same directory as the global
preferences file.

The personal F<disabled_protos> file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.

Note: Whenever the disabled protocols list is saved by using the I<Save>
button in the I<Analyze:Enabled Protocols> dialog box, your personal
disabled protocols file will be overwritten with the new settings,
destroying any comments that were in the file.

=item Name Resolution (hosts)

If the personal F<hosts> file exists, it is
used to resolve IPv4 and IPv6 addresses before any other
attempts are made to resolve them.  The file has the standard F<hosts>
file syntax; each line contains one IP address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The same directory as for the personal preferences file is used.

Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal F<hosts> file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.

=item Name Resolution (subnets)

If an IPv4 address cannot be translated via name resolution (no exact
match is found) then a partial match is attempted via the F<subnets> file.
Both the global F<subnets> file and personal F<subnets> files are used
if they exist.

Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length
separated only by a / and a name separated by whitespace. While the address
must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the mask length are subsequently
ignored.

An example is:

# Comments must be prepended by the # sign!
192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network

A partially matched name will be printed as "subnet-name.remaining-address".
For example, "192.168.0.1" under the subnet above would be printed as
"ws_test_network.1"; if the mask length above had been 16 rather than 24, the
printed address would be ``ws_test_network.0.1".

=item Name Resolution (ethers)

The F<ethers> files are consulted to correlate 6-byte hardware addresses to
names.  First the personal F<ethers> file is tried and if an address is not
found there the global F<ethers> file is tried next.

Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by
whitespace.  The digits of the hardware address are separated by colons
(:), dashes (-) or periods (.).  The same separator character must be
used consistently in an address.  The following three lines are valid
lines of an F<ethers> file:

  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
  c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff          TR_broadcast
  00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast

The global F<ethers> file is looked for in the F</etc> directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, F<C:\Program Files\Wireshark>) on Windows systems.

The personal F<ethers> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal
preferences file.

Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible
systems and WinPcap on Windows.  As such the Wireshark personal F<ethers> file
will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.

=item Name Resolution (manuf)

The F<manuf> file is used to match the 3-byte vendor portion of a 6-byte
hardware address with the manufacturer's name; it can also contain well-known
MAC addresses and address ranges specified with a netmask.  The format of the
file is the same as the F<ethers> files, except that entries such as:

  00:00:0C      Cisco

can be provided, with the 3-byte OUI and the name for a vendor, and
entries such as:

  00-00-0C-07-AC/40     All-HSRP-routers

can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask indicating how many bits
of the address must match.  The above entry, for example, has 40
significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
00-00-0C-07-AC-00 through 00-00-0C-07-AC-FF.  The mask need not be a
multiple of 8.

The F<manuf> file is looked for in the same directory as the global
preferences file.

=item Name Resolution (services)

The F<services> file is used to translate port numbers into names.
Both the global F<services> file and personal F<services> files are used
if they exist.

The file has the standard F<services> file syntax; each line contains one
(service) name and one transport identifier separated by white space.  The
transport identifier includes one port number and one transport protocol name
(typically tcp, udp, or sctp) separated by a /.

An example is:

mydns       5045/udp     # My own Domain Name Server
mydns       5045/tcp     # My own Domain Name Server

=item Name Resolution (ipxnets)

The F<ipxnets> files are used to correlate 4-byte IPX network numbers to
names.  First the global F<ipxnets> file is tried and if that address is not
found there the personal one is tried next.

The format is the same as the F<ethers>
file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal
number, as is more common in the IPX world, rather than four hex octets.
For example, these four lines are valid lines of an F<ipxnets> file:

  C0.A8.2C.00              HR
  c0-a8-1c-00              CEO
  00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
  110f                     FileServer3

The global F<ipxnets> file is looked for in the F</etc> directory on
UNIX-compatible systems, and in the main installation directory (for
example, F<C:\Program Files\Wireshark>) on Windows systems.

The personal F<ipxnets> file is looked for in the same directory as the
personal preferences file.

=item Capture Filters

The F<cfilters> files contain system-wide and personal capture filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:

  "HTTP" port 80
  "DCERPC" port 135

The global F<cfilters> file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.

The personal F<cfilters> file uses the same directory as the personal
preferences file.  It is written through the Capture:Capture Filters
dialog.

If the global F<cfilters> file exists, it is used only if the personal
F<cfilters> file does not exist; global and personal capture filters are
not merged.

=item Display Filters

The F<dfilters> files contain system-wide and personal display filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter string itself:

  "HTTP" http
  "DCERPC" dcerpc

The global F<dfilters> file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.

The personal F<dfilters> file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.  It is written through the Analyze:Display
Filters dialog.

If the global F<dfilters> file exists, it is used only if the personal
F<dfilters> file does not exist; global and personal display filters are
not merged.

=item Color Filters (Coloring Rules)

The F<colorfilters> files contain system-wide and personal color filters.
Each line contains one filter, starting with the string displayed in the
dialog box, followed by the corresponding display filter.  Then the
background and foreground colors are appended:

  # a comment
  @tcp@tcp@[59345,58980,65534][0,0,0]
  @udp@udp@[28834,57427,65533][0,0,0]

The global F<colorfilters> file uses the same directory as the
global preferences file.

The personal F<colorfilters> file uses the same directory as the
personal preferences file.  It is written through the View:Coloring Rules
dialog.

If the global F<colorfilters> file exists, it is used only if the personal
F<colorfilters> file does not exist; global and personal color filters are
not merged.

=item Plugins

See above in the description of the About:Plugins page.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR

This environment variable overrides the location of personal configuration
files. It defaults to F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark> (or F<$HOME/.wireshark> if
the former is missing while the latter exists). On Windows,
F<%APPDATA%\Wireshark> is used instead. Available since Wireshark 3.0.

=item WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE

Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the
specified allocator backend for *all* allocations, regardless of which
backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly useful to developers
when testing or debugging. See I<README.wmem> in the source distribution for
details.

=item WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY

This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded
from the build directory (where the program was compiled) rather than from the
standard locations.  It has no effect when the program in question is running
with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.

=item WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR

This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from
a directory other than the standard locations.  It has no effect when the
program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on *NIX.

=item ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK

This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the ERF format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.

=item IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK

This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when
deciding if a file really is in the IPFIX format.  Setting this environment
variable a number higher than the default (20) would make false positives
less likely.

=item WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG

If this environment variable is set, B<Wireshark> will call abort(3)
when a dissector bug is encountered.  abort(3) will cause the program to
exit abnormally; if you are running B<Wireshark> in a debugger, it
should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if
you are not running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming
your environment is configured correctly, generate a core dump file.
This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem
with a protocol dissector.

=item WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS

If this environment variable is set, B<Wireshark> will call abort(3)
if a dissector tries to add too many items to a tree (generally this
is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon enough).
abort(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running
B<Wireshark> in a debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow
inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a debugger,
it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
generate a core dump file.  This can be useful to developers attempting to
troubleshoot a problem with a protocol dissector.

=item WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE

Cause B<Wireshark> to exit after the end of the capture session.  This
doesn't automatically start a capture; you must still use B<-k> to do
that.  You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g.  B<-c> or B<-a
duration:...>.  This means that you will not be able to see the results
of the capture after it stops; it's primarily useful for testing.
